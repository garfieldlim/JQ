These issues may be complex but their antidote is contrarily simple. An answer is found in Immanuel Kantâ€™s thought on moral culture which pertains to three essential features, namely: obedience, truthfulness, and sociableness. This qualitative research focuses on the fundamental ideas in the section on moral culture in Kantâ€™s On Education. As my contribution to the fund of knowledge, I proceed by establishing the implications and antitheses of the three features of Kantâ€™s moral culture. A discussion on obedience differentiates its two kinds: absolute and voluntary. Absolute obedience is the result of compulsion by a command, while voluntary obedience is the result of confidence by a reasonable will. It is impossible to think of character formation without also thinking of truthfulness. Kant asserts that a man who tells lies has no character. Sociableness emphasizes on the importance of building relationships and friendships. The researcher contends that these three features of moral culture have corresponding antitheses: violation of laws of the land for obedience; lying and dishonesty (highest form is corruption in politics) for truthfulness; and human rights violation (highest form is war) for sociableness. Finally, these features are imperative in forging peace and social order which usher to a kind of development that people aspire. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/112',

the possible effects of midterm grades to the evaluation results of teachers at the end of the semester.Â  The study utilized data mining approach using midterm grades and evaluation results of full-time and part-time faculty members.Â  Both parametric and non-parametric analyses were employed in the study. Findings revealed a weak correlation between the midterm grades of students and their evaluation rating of teachers.Â  Looking at grading leniency versus teacher status, it was found out that grades of full-time faculty was significantly higher compared to part time and grades of tenured faculty was significantly higher compared to their probationary counterpart.Â  Therefore, administrators in higher education institution, who uses studentâ€™s evaluation result as a key indicator of instructorâ€™s effectiveness, should be very careful as these results might not represent the true performance of a teacher inside the classroom. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/135', 'embeds': [-0.0001693172, -0.063174896, 0.02085247, -0.018021885, -0.013802382,

varying amount of herbal extract has also been reported, thus, requiring toxicity-profiling studies. Here, the toxicity of C. cebuense leaf extract (CCLE) was evaluated using brine shrimp lethality assay (BSLA) and anthelminthic assay under a complete randomized design with equal replications. Results in BSLA revealed an LC50 value of 7.05 Î¼g/ml (pâ‰¤0.05) which is considerably medium-toxic based on standard toxicity criterion. Influence on earthworm activity showed significant difference (pâ‰¤0.01) among the different concentrations of the extract (100 mg/ml, 75 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, and 25 mg/ml) following a concentration-dependent response trend. Results suggest strong toxicity against earthworms at 75â€“100 mg/ml while having a moderate to weak toxicity at 25â€“50mg/ml. Both assays were able to elucidate toxicity of CCLE which may be due to the presence of cinnamaldehyde, the main phytochemical found in cinnamon leaves. CCLE is toxic at elevated dosages and thus warrants parallel studies using higher-vertebrate models. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/625', 'embeds': [-0.005668787,

educational system. With the abrupt shift of the teaching-learning process, teachers are pressured and stressed, which leads them to be burned out. The descriptive correlational research design determines the direct and indirect effects of perceived control to burnout through teachersâ€™ personality traits of the 240 early childhood teachers. Data are analyzed using the Pearson r formula, Bivariate parametric correlation, and the Structural Equation Model (SEM). The study reveals that despite the challenges experienced in this time of pandemic, teachers have control over themselves and with the people around them. The teachersâ€™ level of control does not influence their burnout; instead, their burnout is dependent on their emotional stability. Thus, burnout is a personal choice which is triggered by oneâ€™s emotion. A person with high perceived control may still be burned out if he does not have control over his emotions. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/964', 'embeds':

of Fire brings enormous threat to its people. Intervention and innovation are to be in place for survival and growth, since nothing can be done about its geographic location and the threats that come with it. This study aims to create a framework for developing a decision support system, a mobile and web application for the efficient implementation of the disaster logistics support system. The study will utilize Agile Methodology for the software development in the proposed framework. This proposed framework exhibits the features of the system such as identifying location, affected families, supplies, reports, management of inventory, vehicle outsourcing, and monitoring. The system framework can be a helpful tool for the efficient and speedy delivery of needed help and an effective approach to disaster supply chain issues. link:

These issues may be complex but their antidote is contrarily simple. An answer is found in Immanuel Kantâ€™s thought on moral culture which pertains to three essential features, namely: obedience, truthfulness, and sociableness. This qualitative research focuses on the fundamental ideas in the section on moral culture in Kantâ€™s On Education. As my contribution to the fund of knowledge, I proceed by establishing the implications and antitheses of the three features of Kantâ€™s moral culture. A discussion on obedience differentiates its two kinds: absolute and voluntary. Absolute obedience is the result of compulsion by a command, while voluntary obedience is the result of confidence by a reasonable will. It is impossible to think of character formation without also thinking of truthfulness. Kant asserts that a man who tells lies has no character. Sociableness emphasizes on the importance of building relationships and friendships. The researcher contends that these three features of moral culture have corresponding antitheses: violation of laws of the land for obedience; lying and dishonesty (highest form is corruption in politics) for truthfulness; and human rights violation (highest form is war) for sociableness. Finally, these features are imperative in forging peace and social order which usher to a kind of development that people aspire. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/112',\n",

Findings revealed a weak correlation between the midterm grades of students and their evaluation rating of teachers.Â  Looking at grading leniency versus teacher status, it was found out that grades of full-time faculty was significantly higher compared to part time and grades of tenured faculty was significantly higher compared to their probationary counterpart.Â  Therefore, administrators in higher education institution, who uses studentâ€™s evaluation result as a key indicator of instructorâ€™s effectiveness, should be very careful as these results might not represent the true performance of a teacher inside the classroom. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/135',\n",

It adheres to the policy that all articles contained therein must meet the rigors of an independent double-blind peer-reviewing system and editing to ensure that the publication possesses scientific and academic merit., The Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal (RMRJ) is the official bi-annual journal of the University of San Jose-Recoletos (USJ-R) Center for Policy, Research, and Development Studies (CPRDS).  Being an internationally peer-reviewed journal, RMRJ adopts the double-blind review process wherein the reviewer/s and the author/s do not know each other's identity., RMRJ is dedicated to promoting knowledge through high-quality research publications in various disciplines. She is committed to editorial independence, diversity, and equity. Submissions from people of different backgrounds and geographic locations are welcome. Submissions are assigned to editors who will do the initial review. Should the manuscript be suitable for consideration by RMRJ, the paper will be sent to at least two independent peer reviewers. The peer reviewers' assessments are used to inform the associate editor's decision on whether or not to recommend publication. Endorsed papers will be forwarded to the Chief Editor for final approval. \\n\\nWe do not put up with rude behavior or letters directed at our editors, staff, or other people helping us publish. We have the right to take appropriate measures to safeguard others from it. This situation may involve, for instance, withdrawing a manuscript from consideration or objecting to offensive remarks made by peers., A manuscript is accepted when\\n\\nit is endorsed for publication by at least two referees,\\nit substantially complies with the instructions of the reviewers;\\nit complies with the ethical standards and protocols with studies involving humans and animals;\\nthe manuscript passed the plagiarism detection test with a score of at most 10% Similarity Index and a Grammarly Rating of 95% or more. Otherwise, the manuscript is returned to the author(s).\\nThe referees' evaluations include an explicit recommendation of what to do with the manuscript, chosen from options provided by the journal. Most recommendations are along the following lines:\\n\\nAccept without revisions\\nAccept with minor revisions\\nAccept with major revisions\\nReject with the option to resubmit\\nReject\\nIn situations where the referees disagree substantially about the quality of work, there are several strategies for reaching a decision. When the editor receives positive and negative reviews for the same manuscript, the board will solicit one or more additional reviews as a tie-breaker. In the case of ties, the board may invite authors to reply to a referee's criticisms and permit a compelling rebuttal to break the tie. Suppose the editor does not feel confident in weighing the persuasiveness of a rebuttal. In that case, the board may solicit a response from the referee who made the original criticism. In rare instances, the board will convey communications between an author and a referee, thereby allowing them to debate on a point. Even in such a case, however, the board does not allow referees to confer with each other, and the goal of the process is explicitly not to reach a consensus or to convince anyone to change his/ her opinions., RMRJ welcomes submission of quality researches in any of the following academic domains:\\n\\nAccountancy, Business and Management, and Finance;\\nCommunication, Humanities, Psychology, and Religion;\\nEducation and Educational Management;\\nEngineering, Mathematics, Statistics, and Technology;\\nEnvironment, Health, and Natural Sciences;\\nPhilosophical and Mathematical Reviews; and\\nPolitics and Governance, and Social Sciences., RMRJ welcomes the submission of comments on previous articles. Comments on articles previously published in the journal will generally be reviewed by two reviewers, usually an author of the original article (to assist the editor in evaluating whether the submitted comment represents the previous article's accuracy) and an independent reviewer. The original author will be invited to reply if a comment is accepted for publication. All other editorial requirements, as enumerated above, apply to proposed comments., The names and email addresses entered in this journal site will be used exclusively for the stated purposes of this journal and will not be made available for any other purpose or to any other party., Peer review (also known as refereeing) is the process of subjecting an author's scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field. It requires a community of experts in a given (and often narrowly defined) field who are qualified and able to perform impartial reviews. Likewise, it also refers to the work done while screening submitted manuscripts and funding applications. This normative process encourages authors to meet the accepted standards of their discipline. It prevents disseminating unwarranted claims, unacceptable interpretations, and personal views. Peer review increases the probability that weaknesses will be identified and fixed. For both grant funding and publication in a scholarly journal, it is also usually required that the subject be both novel and substantial.\\n\\nReviewers and editors are responsible for providing a constructive and prompt evaluation of submitted research papers based on the significance of their contribution and the rigors of analysis and presentation.\\n\\nThere are two or three referees for a given article. Two are experts on the topic, and one is an expert in research and statistics who shall review the technical components of the research. These referees revert the evaluation of the work that indicates the observed weaknesses or problems along with suggestions for improvement. The board then evaluates the referees' comments and notes the opinion of the manuscript before passing the decision with the referees' comments back to the author(s)., RMRJ makes it a point of adhering to COPE's Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing, and we encourage our publishing partners to do the same.\",\n",

Here, the toxicity of C. cebuense leaf extract (CCLE) was evaluated using brine shrimp lethality assay (BSLA) and anthelminthic assay under a complete randomized design with equal replications. Results in BSLA revealed an LC50 value of 7.05 Î¼g/ml (pâ‰¤0.05) which is considerably medium-toxic based on standard toxicity criterion. Influence on earthworm activity showed significant difference (pâ‰¤0.01) among the different concentrations of the extract (100 mg/ml, 75 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, and 25 mg/ml) following a concentration-dependent response trend. Results suggest strong toxicity against earthworms at 75â€“100 mg/ml while having a moderate to weak toxicity at 25â€“50mg/ml. Both assays were able to elucidate toxicity of CCLE which may be due to the presence of cinnamaldehyde, the main phytochemical found in cinnamon leaves. CCLE is toxic at elevated dosages and thus warrants parallel studies using higher-vertebrate models. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/625',\n",

With the abrupt shift of the teaching-learning process, teachers are pressured and stressed, which leads them to be burned out. The descriptive correlational research design determines the direct and indirect effects of perceived control to burnout through teachersâ€™ personality traits of the 240 early childhood teachers. Data are analyzed using the Pearson r formula, Bivariate parametric correlation, and the Structural Equation Model (SEM). The study reveals that despite the challenges experienced in this time of pandemic, teachers have control over themselves and with the people around them. The teachersâ€™ level of control does not influence their burnout; instead, their burnout is dependent on their emotional stability. Thus, burnout is a personal choice which is triggered by oneâ€™s emotion. A person with high perceived control may still be burned out if he does not have control over his emotions. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/964',\n",

The board then evaluates the referees' comments and notes the opinion of the manuscript before passing the decision with the referees' comments back to the author(s)., A manuscript is accepted when\\n\\nit is endorsed for publication by at least two referees,\\nit substantially complies with the instructions of the reviewers;\\nit complies with the ethical standards and protocols with studies involving humans and animals;\\nthe manuscript passed the plagiarism detection test with a score of at most 10% Similarity Index and a Grammarly Rating of 95% or more. Otherwise, the manuscript is returned to the author(s).\\nThe referees' evaluations include an explicit recommendation of what to do with the manuscript, chosen from options provided by the journal. Most recommendations are along the following lines:\\n\\nAccept without revisions\\nAccept with minor revisions\\nAccept with major revisions\\nReject with the option to resubmit\\nReject\\nIn situations where the referees disagree substantially about the quality of work, there are several strategies for reaching a decision. When the editor receives positive and negative reviews for the same manuscript, the board will solicit one or more additional reviews as a tie-breaker. In the case of ties, the board may invite authors to reply to a referee's criticisms and permit a compelling rebuttal to break the tie. Suppose the editor does not feel confident in weighing the persuasiveness of a rebuttal. In that case, the board may solicit a response from the referee who made the original criticism. In rare instances, the board will convey communications between an author and a referee, thereby allowing them to debate on a point. Even in such a case, however, the board does not allow referees to confer with each other, and the goal of the process is explicitly not to reach a consensus or to convince anyone to change his/ her opinions., All authors submitting their works to the RMRJ for publication as original articles attest that the submitted works represent their authors' contributions and have not been copied or plagiarized in whole or in part from other works.\\n\\nRMRJ adheres to COPE's first two requirements in defining authorship:  a. making a substantial contribution to the work and b. being accountable for the work and its published form. Substantial contribution includes revising the manuscript to include important intellectual content.\\n\\nCorresponding authors are to use their institutional email in the submission process. All contributing authors are to be declared upon submission. Their names, ORCID number, and affiliation are to be written on the cover page and submitted separately in the journal's portal as a separate file. Only authors whose names are found on the cover page upon submission are acknowledged as authors.   Individuals who do not meet the criteria for authorship may be mentioned in the Acknowledgements section of their publication., RMRJ is dedicated to promoting knowledge through high-quality research publications in various disciplines. She is committed to editorial independence, diversity, and equity. Submissions from people of different backgrounds and geographic locations are welcome. Submissions are assigned to editors who will do the initial review. Should the manuscript be suitable for consideration by RMRJ, the paper will be sent to at least two independent peer reviewers. The peer reviewers' assessments are used to inform the associate editor's decision on whether or not to recommend publication. Endorsed papers will be forwarded to the Chief Editor for final approval. \\n\\nWe do not put up with rude behavior or letters directed at our editors, staff, or other people helping us publish. We have the right to take appropriate measures to safeguard others from it. This situation may involve, for instance, withdrawing a manuscript from consideration or objecting to offensive remarks made by peers., RMRJ makes it a point of adhering to COPE's Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing, and we encourage our publishing partners to do the same., The RECOLETOS MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH JOURNAL (RMRJ) is committed to upholding the highest standards of publication ethics and takes all possible measures against publication malpractices. RMRJ commits herself to objective and fair double-blind peer-review of the submitted for publication works and to prevent any actual or potential conflict of interests between the editorial and review personnel and the reviewed material. Any departures from the stipulated guidelines should be reported directly to the Editor-in-Chief, who is unequivocally committed to providing swift resolutions to any such problems., RMRJ does not endorse significant publication overlap. When overlap is necessary, it is only permitted if the manuscript may advance the field of study, has the explicit endorsement of the original publication, and cites the original source. (Cambridge University Press, Version 4.0, September 20, 2021)., We reserve the right to review all contributions using proper plagiarism detection software, such as Turnitin. The journal permits a similarity rating of no more than 10%. Submissions that have more than the permitted rating will be rejected or given the option to resubmit. We will adhere to the procedures indicated in the Retractions section of these guidelines if plagiarism is found after publication. Any allegations of plagiarism should be reported to us by our readers, reviewers, and editors., RMRJ picks its reviewers through its editorial office. When a manuscript arrives, an editor solicits reviews from scholars or other experts to referee the manuscript. The identities of the referees selected by the Editorial Board are kept unknown to research authors. However, the reviewer's identity can be disclosed under some particular circumstances. Disclosure of Peer Review can be granted under the following grounds: as evidence to prove that the published paper underwent peer review as required by the University for ranking and financial incentives, for regulatory bodies such as the Commission on Higher Education, Accreditation of Academic Programs. Requests for peer review results shall be made in writing., RMRJ welcomes the submission of comments on previous articles.

Factors such as slope, soil type; land cover and groundwater depth were used as input parameters. Around 98% of the existing shallow tube-wells were within the suitable area. The developed map was validated using existing irrigated areas. Results show that more than 377,000 hectares were found potentially suitable locations for shallow tube-well irrigation development. These areas are characterized with a water table depth of <6.5 m, a slope of<18%, soil textures (sandy loam, clay loam, and sandy clay). Sufficient factors in combination with the GIS tool is a great tool to carry out spatial data in land-use analysis and the use of this as a means in identifying viable locations for shallow tube-well irrigation development in other places is reliable. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/491',\n",

Consequently, this indicates the necessity of developing an awareness and a comprehensive knowledge among the role of various stakeholders in their contribution to construction health and safety improvement. As part of the construction industry stakeholders, the role of localities is one of the factors to consider in the formation of construction health and safety knowledge and practice. Despite the plethora of construction health and safety studies found in the literature, there have been very few studies that have considered the association between localities and their association with construction health and safety practices. In this paper, a Chi-square test of independence is used to investigate whether a disparity between localities and their safety practices exists. Moreover, this study contributes to existing literature in such a way that it is the first to consider the relationship between intra-locality and health and safety practices in the context of the construction industry.

A camera is fixed at the center front view of the concrete beams to capture the deflection of the samples while testing. In each test, a dial indicator is installed and the maximum deflection is manually recorded. Based on the results, the maximum deflection values recorded by the proposed application obtained an average error of 18.38 % when compared to the manual measured results.

There are four modelled scenarios based on the combination of interruptible load program and the time-of-use scheme. The scenarios were modelled using a Binary Particle Swarm Optimization and were simulated using Matlab v6. In all the scenarios, this model successfully optimizes the battery dispatch scheduling while simultaneously minimizes the DUâ€™s penalty from exceeding the maximum allowable power demand. This algorithm also optimizes the linearly forecasted demand for the next six year for all the scenarios. Then, an economic analysis for the possible investment to the combined BESS and PV system is conducted through the comparison of the payback periods of each scenario. The first scenario is implemented without ILP and a ToU scheme and has 79.86 payback years. With ILP scheme only, the second scenario has 33.37 payback years. Then the third scenario with ToU scheme only has a 30.29 payback years. Finally, the fourth scenario, with both ILP and ToU schemes, shows the fastest recovery of the investment with 21.57 payback years. Thus the combination of both ILP and ToU schemes provide the best economic benefit.

Findings revealed that Latvian teachers experienced higher cases of depression, anxiety, and stress than Filipino teachers. In contrast, Latvian students exhibit lower cases of depression and anxiety than Filipino students. Thus, mental health conditions of both teachers and students of both countries must be prioritized by conducting various programs and activities which further demands that mental health must be considered in academic institutions because when human resource knows how to deal with depression, anxiety, and stress, they also make better choices in life which will make them corollarily become even more productive at work. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1328',\n",

It has been widely practiced, developed, and discussed in government, political, and industrial sectors due to its massive impact on tackling issues related to climate change and global warming as well as presenting opportunities to cut energy costs. Despite the active discussion of this topic in the literature, very few papers have discussed it in the context of academic institutions which has one of the most significant impacts in terms of energy consumption. To address the issue, this paper places the topic of energy conservation in the context of academic institutions. Moreover, it adopts the Theory of Planned Behavior to investigate the success of energy conservation initiatives in academic institutions by looking at user behavior and its antecedents. Finally, this paper contributes significantly to the literature as it is one of the very few papers and arguably the first to discuss energy conservation in the context of academic institutions using the Theory of Planned Behavior. Furthermore, this paper will be beneficial for practitioners and other stakeholders in that it provides them with a framework to investigate the success of implementing energy conservation initiatives, especially, in academic institutions by looking at the antecedents of user behavior. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/550',\n",

It utilized multiple factors that can be useful for policy and investment decisions and are intended to complement analyses using financial poverty indicators. Using exploratory data analysis, several indicators were selected to represent the different dimensions of poverty. Said indicators were then subjected to factor analysis which yielded four multidimensional indices namely: General Welfare Index, Governance and Emotional Landscape Index, and Social Climate Index. Singapore, Brunei, and Malaysia ranked 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in all three indices, respectively. In addition, multivariate cluster analysis was also performed. It revealed that Singapore exhibited exceptional performance in all indices, thereby earning it a cluster all to its own. Similarities were observed between Brunei and Malaysia while Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, and Indonesia were clustered together. Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar belonged to another cluster, indicating similarities among them. The study concluded that a wide gap exists among ASEAN countries in terms of the various deprivations measured. It also identified several problem areas and strengths of the ASEAN member states.

Hence, this study focuses on understanding how educators of technology-based courses in public higher education across academic landscapes have navigated for continuous instructional delivery. This study utilizes the Straussian approach of Grounded Theory. This design uses a three-stage coding methodology: open, axial, and selective coding. The study generates the Theory of Educators Teaching Technology-Based Courses across academic landscapes, which postulates that educators in technology-based courses undergo phases of metamorphosis that include visioning, learning, rationalizing and doing, and modernizing, ultimately allowing them to become resilient and adaptive to the shifting landscapes of the academe caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1572',\n",

The pre-defined indicators were categorized as indexes labeled as Input-Process-Output-Outcome. Results show that change in the Outcome of HE varies depending on the variables involved in the analysis. Considering full data, data with QCE and data of senior faculty, Inputs, Processes, and Outputs significantly contribute towards an improved (Outcome) faculty accomplishment (FA). The analysis on junior faculty (JF), showed that only Inputs and Outputs were significantly affecting change on Outcome of HE.

The study was conducted in the municipality of Sagbayan, Bohol, Philippines. The researcher utilized a self-made questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Scale, Spiritual Wellbeing Scale and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) to gather the needed information relevant to the variables under study. Multiple regression and analysis of variance through the SPSS software were utilized in the treatment and analysis of the data. It was found out that the mean level of subjective wellbeing among elderly falls under the average level of life satisfaction which means that the elderlies are generally satisfied with the different aspects of their lives but there are certain domains that they would very much like to improve. The study also revealed that the significant predictive variables for the elderliesâ€™ subjective wellbeing include age, health status, perceived stress, community participation, family income, and neighborhood safety.

Keeping this in view, an indirect heat copra dryer with phase changer (IHCDPC) was designed, fabricated, and evaluated in the hopes of providing farmers an alternative approach in drying copra, which may yield to producing a high-quality grade product. The developed IHCDPC was able to reduce the moisture content in fresh coconut meat from 57.4% w.b. to about 7.2% w.b. for a drying time of twenty-five hours.

Functional relationships between these social parameters and the disease parameters determined the model developed in this study and used predictive agent-based model to simulate the level of spread of HIV cases in Cebu with base data of the risky lifestyle of BPO agents in the region that could make them vulnerable to infections. Simulation results revealed that there is a rise on the incidence of HIV infections every year, which could become an epidemic in the future if no immediate intervention will be done.

In seeking for solutions, we apply the Student Self â€“Assessment (SSA) method and Newman Error Analysis (NEA) method to circumvent these errors. The SSA is a strong formative educational tool that enhances selfconfidence to become more independent in assessing their work. While, NEA serves as a powerful classroom diagnostic assessment to identify the skills of the students. It enables the teacher to devise and apply more appropriate teaching strategies and procedures that ignite the studentsâ€™ interest towards the subject. Out of the 179-students participating in the action research project, we discover that most of the error patterns are due to lack of understanding and transformation skills in solving word problems. With this result, the students encounter language difficulty and immature computational skills. To this end, the investigation and remediation of common math errors was a success in improving and achieving the learning goals and promotes positive behavioral changes towards the subject.

The sample comprised 964 adolescents from 20 secondary schools across Malaysia. Using logistic regression, results demonstrated that stressful life events and maternal verbal aggression significantly predicted symptoms of depression. In the moderation tests, sex significantly interacted with stressful life events and parental verbal aggression in predicting depressive symptoms.

This is performed initially by developing an actual setup calibrated though the comparison with the hypothesized values. Then, an experiment on this calibrated setup generates the measurement results of varying the displacement positions and the illumination levels. Through descriptive and comparative statistical analysis, there is evidence that the variations of the displacement alone do not significantly change the measurement results. Similarly, the variations in the illumination levels do not also constitute significant changes on the measurement results. Hence, each of the variables bears no contribution on the occurrence of the measurement error of using camera. It is further confirmed through the two way analysis of variance that there is no significant difference on the displacement positions and illumination levels, and on their interactions.

This study endeavors to provide empirical evidence on the effectiveness of the Feynman Technique as a heutagogy-based learning strategy that fits the e-learning landscape. Utilizing true experimental research design, grades 4, 7, and 11 students from typical elementary and national high schools were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups and underwent pre- and posttests. Using two-sample and paired T-tests, results show that students under the experimental group, which applied the Feynman Technique, showed higher posttest scores and learning gains than those in the control group. Hence, this study proves that the Feynman Technique can be an effective tool to improve K-12 studentsâ€™ learning, especially now given the new learning delivery modalities. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/958',\n",

To achieve this aim, I employ Ricoeurâ€™s hermeneutics of symbols because in his different political essays, he consistently regards political power as akin to a symbol. Thus, for him, the critical appropriation of political power requires a hermeneutical procedure. And so in my discussion, I devote one section for Ricoeurâ€™s hermeneutics of symbols, one for his thoughts on political power, and another one for the critical appropriation of political power through the hermeneutics of symbols. To put Ricoeurâ€™s political and hermeneutical thoughts in a better light, I introduce these sections with a separate section on his philosophical anthropology. In my conclusion, I affirm that transforming political structures into just institutions is very much possible through the critical appropriation of political power. It is such a potential tool in effecting these transformations because the critical appropriation of political power involves a hermeneutical procedure that follows a three-step process of reflection. And reflection, which makes way for the critical appropriation of political power, is what ensures that power rests only in the hands of those who are more likely to advance the common good, resulting into a greater possibility for the transformation of political structures into just institutions. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/387',\n",

Results indicated that with the rapid expansion of the Higher Education(HE) market, the size of the higher education labor force will inevitably expand.The labor market tolerates a maximum expansion capacity for HE graduates beyond which the excess HE graduates will bifurcate into two (2) channels of productive sector, namely: (a) the creation of new economies or (b) the integration of HE graduates into the skilled labor force. This dynamics necessarily yields a highly fragmented labor force configuration. In essence, the evolution of the labor market is a replica of Darwinâ€™s Biological Theory of Evolution where only the fittest will survive, i.e. evolution through mutation and adaptation whose equivalent concepts in this setting are â€œinnovationâ€ and â€œadaptationâ€ respectively. It is well-established in Evolutionary Biology that â€œmutationâ€ is the shortest-route to evolution and so we posit that â€œinnovationâ€ is the shortest route to the labor market evolutionary ladder.Therefore, a good university must be able to produce graduates who are innovative and adaptive at the same time to survive in a competitive labor market. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/18',\n",

Increasing atmospheric temperature had changed the dynamics of the mosquito habitats and thereby influences distribution of these mosquito vectors. We examined the increase in the number of countries within the regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas reporting laboratory confirmed dengue cases caused by DENV-1 as a response to increasing global surface temperature difference. Data on the number of countries with confirmed reports of dengue (Messina et al. 2014) and surface temperature difference (General Circulation Model) were subjected to scatter plots and linear regression. There were 113 recorded countries across three regions (America=44, comprising the North and South; Africa=28; and Asia=41) reporting dengue incidence from 1943 to 2013, of which 98 countries (America=41; Africa=20; and Asia=37 with the inclusion of Australia) reported confirmed dengue cases caused by DENV-1. Findings suggest that the effect of temperature to the expansion of dengue varies dramatically in certain groups of country. Here, we explore three patterns (PAT) of expansion response where 1) continuous increase in temperature results into a continuous increase in the number of countries with dengue cases (PAT-A), 2) initial increase in temperature results into increase in the number of countries with dengue cases but subsequent increase in temperature results in the decline of dengue expansion (PAT-B), and 3) initial increase in temperature results into higher rate of dengue expansion but continued increase slows it down (PAT-C). PAT-A represented the majority of these countries, including 10 out of 11 countries in Southeast Asia.

It further reveals that index and non-index crime rate is not a hindrance for a person to move in the area with many opportunities as long as life is not at stake. There were more educated individuals in regions with lower GRDP; however, they practiced and worked in highly developed areas and where law is enforced, eyeing a better condition of life.

Even if the country has high solar insolation, energy conversion is still inefficient since the solar panel arrays are not always facing in perpendicular to the sun. Technologies related to increasing the solar panel efficiency such as solar trackers are usually complex and expensive. This problem is addressed by designing a low cost dual axis solar tracker with the integration of specular reflector system. The dual axis tracker system can move the panel and the reflector assembly in a precise and controlled manner to ensure maximum output. This was achieved by using a LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) compass assembly, gear system, and stepper motor mechanism. To measure the solar panel output, a voltage sensing circuit was incorporated instead of using the existing optical and time-based techniques. The system performance was tested in both the controlled and the actual environments. Experimental data have shown that when the panel is perpendicular to the light source, the system yields maximum energy. The need for a tracking and planar reflector system is notably important when the light source moves away from the normal because this results to a significant drop of the panelâ€™s average efficiency. The addition of the tracker alone had greater enhancement effect than with the specular reflector only. The tracker boosts the efficiency by 69.55% while the specular reflector boosts it by only 15.12%. Combining the tracker and the specular reflector yields the best result with a 92.33% boost on the average efficiency. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/210',\n",

This paper attempts to develop a model that could predict how many years a facility (private or government) would last based on the given number of assumptions and random data. The study used an experimental design using simulation modeling. Assumptions were formulated to measure different variables. Findings revealed that government facilities tend to deteriorate faster compared to its private counterparts. Government facilities would only last approximately up to six (6) years then reach its critical level. This is due to the assumption that only 40% of government institutions are effective workers. Low percentage of effective workers would translate to less motivation of the worker to pursue any transaction that could possibly help the current state of the facility. On the other hand, more than half of the Private facilities would last more than five years before reaching a critical level. This is due to the assumption that private workers are 20% higher compared to government workers in terms of percentage of effective workers. A highly motivated worker will always be willing to spend time, even extra time, to perform his job. Benign neglect of a less motivated workforce would result to non performance of his assigned task. Therefore, increasing the level of motivation of an employee is the primordial concern of every organization whether private or public because an increase of well motivated and effective workforce would encourage everyone to help maintain and to extend the life of every facility. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/26',\n",

Fourteen key informants were identified with the aid of two sampling methods- snowball technique and purposive sampling. Open-ended questionnaires were employed to obtain authentic and significant information from the key informants. An inventory on the knowledge on the wild edible and medicinal insects in the study areas is presented here. Results showedthat these key informants profusely utilized wide range of biological resources in diverse ways, and thus contribute to their daily activities. As a whole, the factors that influenced their entomological practices include their socio-demographic and educational background, accessibility to urban societies and the open availability of certain resources particularly the insects they use and the influence brought about by their family and community. Moreover, these informants had different insects used in their practices, and they had their ways of preparing and administering these as medicines and food.

The study revealed that the parents and the social workers were responsive to the needs of the day care workers.  Seven themes emerged namely: eliciting parents and childrenâ€™s active involvement, improving collaboration and communication, learning from seminars, availing necessities and learning resources, improving pedagogical competence and practices of DCWs, and improving the learning environment. The extension program helped the day care workers established sustainable and effective day care centers through forging and sustaining strong partnerships with parents, government, and non-government organizations. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/970',\n",

It described first-hand real-life experiences of the suicide-loss survivors to determine the contexts, reasons, and implications of suicide and recommend community-based intervention strategies. Purposive-criterion and convenient sampling methods were used to determine the respondents. Focused group discussion and in-depth interviews were conducted to gather data analyzed using Braun & Clarkeâ€™s six-phase guide. The findings revealed that the life experiences of the respondents are characterized by regret, pain, and bereavement. Suicides were committed due to dysfunctional families, economic hardships, breakdown of relationships, and drug abuse. The pain of suicide affected both the victim and their survivors and occurs within the psychosocial sphere. Interventions should therefore employ a familial, communitarian, and inter-institutional approach. Local Government Units (LGUs) are recommended to initiate a reach-out community-based suicide intervention program and debriefing services. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1206',\n",

The industry contributes US$17.6 billion through exports in 2012. At present, the demand for crude palm oil has soared high due to the increasing awareness of the varied uses of palm oil. The challenge to countries cultivating oil palm is how to cope with the local and global demand .The focus now is to increase plantation areas to produce a higher volume of crude oil to serve the needs of the world market. Today, the total land area planted to oil palm in Indonesia has reached 9.7 million hectares. This study used data mining and Delphi technique. Data were sourced from public domain websites and several databases. This study determined the gap between production and utilization and to provide information to existing industry players ,policy makers, future investors, and would-be entrants to the industry on the latest trends noting the fast development of the industry not only in Indonesia but also in other Southeast Asian countries. Although Indonesia has been successful in providing the local and international market with palm oil products and palm derivatives, it has to benchmark with other palm producing countries to avoid industry stagnation and to intensify diversification particularly in the development of new edible products to take advantage of the health benefits derived from the use of palm oil. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/28',\n",

This qualitative study was explored because there is a dearth of studies focusing on paternal involvement and a lack of local autism research. Nine participants, who were chosen using purposive sampling, individually participated in an unstructured interview. The van Kaam method popularized by Moustakas was used to analyze the data gathered. Five major themes emerged: recognizing the child's needs, surviving hardships, enduring exhaustion, encountering silver linings, and moving forward. The findings showed that fathers of children with autism encountered challenging and fulfilling events during the pandemic with resilience. Fathers of children with autism prioritized familial needs, especially of the child, and increased their presence in the household.

In general, the students demonstrated a very high extent of religiosity, but they significantly differ when compared by grade level, church involvement, mass attendance, and Catholic identity. They had moderate spiritual well-being, but a significant difference was noted between males and females. Nevertheless, a significant relationship exists between religiosity and spiritual wellbeing, which suggests that the more the students observe Catholic teachings and practices, the more they mature in God's personal experience and achieve a sense of satisfaction and purpose in life.

But, as early as 1947, Manuel Yap, bishop and biblical scholar from Carcar, Cebu, objected, saying that the Visayan-Cebuano vocabulary does not fit in the English eight-parts-of-speech classification. This study, then, aims at inquiring into Yapâ€™s own classification of the Visayan-Cebuano vocabulary. In doing this, it uses the descriptive-analysis research design.

An answer is found in Immanuel Kantâ€™s thought on moral culture which pertains to three essential features, namely: obedience, truthfulness, and sociableness. This qualitative research focuses on the fundamental ideas in the section on moral culture in Kantâ€™s On Education. As my contribution to the fund of knowledge, I proceed by establishing the implications and antitheses of the three features of Kantâ€™s moral culture. A discussion on obedience differentiates its two kinds: absolute and voluntary. Absolute obedience is the result of compulsion by a command, while voluntary obedience is the result of confidence by a reasonable will. It is impossible to think of character formation without also thinking of truthfulness. Kant asserts that a man who tells lies has no character. Sociableness emphasizes on the importance of building relationships and friendships. The researcher contends that these three features of moral culture have corresponding antitheses: violation of laws of the land for obedience; lying and dishonesty (highest form is corruption in politics) for truthfulness; and human rights violation (highest form is war) for sociableness. Finally, these features are imperative in forging peace and social order which usher to a kind of development that people aspire. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/112',\n",

Findings revealed a weak correlation between the midterm grades of students and their evaluation rating of teachers.Â  Looking at grading leniency versus teacher status, it was found out that grades of full-time faculty was significantly higher compared to part time and grades of tenured faculty was significantly higher compared to their probationary counterpart.Â  Therefore, administrators in higher education institution, who uses studentâ€™s evaluation result as a key indicator of instructorâ€™s effectiveness, should be very careful as these results might not represent the true performance of a teacher inside the classroom. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/135',\n",

It adheres to the policy that all articles contained therein must meet the rigors of an independent double-blind peer-reviewing system and editing to ensure that the publication possesses scientific and academic merit., The Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal (RMRJ) is the official bi-annual journal of the University of San Jose-Recoletos (USJ-R) Center for Policy, Research, and Development Studies (CPRDS).  Being an internationally peer-reviewed journal, RMRJ adopts the double-blind review process wherein the reviewer/s and the author/s do not know each other's identity., RMRJ is dedicated to promoting knowledge through high-quality research publications in various disciplines. She is committed to editorial independence, diversity, and equity. Submissions from people of different backgrounds and geographic locations are welcome. Submissions are assigned to editors who will do the initial review. Should the manuscript be suitable for consideration by RMRJ, the paper will be sent to at least two independent peer reviewers. The peer reviewers' assessments are used to inform the associate editor's decision on whether or not to recommend publication. Endorsed papers will be forwarded to the Chief Editor for final approval. \\n\\nWe do not put up with rude behavior or letters directed at our editors, staff, or other people helping us publish. We have the right to take appropriate measures to safeguard others from it. This situation may involve, for instance, withdrawing a manuscript from consideration or objecting to offensive remarks made by peers., A manuscript is accepted when\\n\\nit is endorsed for publication by at least two referees,\\nit substantially complies with the instructions of the reviewers;\\nit complies with the ethical standards and protocols with studies involving humans and animals;\\nthe manuscript passed the plagiarism detection test with a score of at most 10% Similarity Index and a Grammarly Rating of 95% or more. Otherwise, the manuscript is returned to the author(s).\\nThe referees' evaluations include an explicit recommendation of what to do with the manuscript, chosen from options provided by the journal. Most recommendations are along the following lines:\\n\\nAccept without revisions\\nAccept with minor revisions\\nAccept with major revisions\\nReject with the option to resubmit\\nReject\\nIn situations where the referees disagree substantially about the quality of work, there are several strategies for reaching a decision. When the editor receives positive and negative reviews for the same manuscript, the board will solicit one or more additional reviews as a tie-breaker. In the case of ties, the board may invite authors to reply to a referee's criticisms and permit a compelling rebuttal to break the tie. Suppose the editor does not feel confident in weighing the persuasiveness of a rebuttal. In that case, the board may solicit a response from the referee who made the original criticism. In rare instances, the board will convey communications between an author and a referee, thereby allowing them to debate on a point. Even in such a case, however, the board does not allow referees to confer with each other, and the goal of the process is explicitly not to reach a consensus or to convince anyone to change his/ her opinions., RMRJ welcomes submission of quality researches in any of the following academic domains:\\n\\nAccountancy, Business and Management, and Finance;\\nCommunication, Humanities, Psychology, and Religion;\\nEducation and Educational Management;\\nEngineering, Mathematics, Statistics, and Technology;\\nEnvironment, Health, and Natural Sciences;\\nPhilosophical and Mathematical Reviews; and\\nPolitics and Governance, and Social Sciences., RMRJ welcomes the submission of comments on previous articles. Comments on articles previously published in the journal will generally be reviewed by two reviewers, usually an author of the original article (to assist the editor in evaluating whether the submitted comment represents the previous article's accuracy) and an independent reviewer. The original author will be invited to reply if a comment is accepted for publication. All other editorial requirements, as enumerated above, apply to proposed comments., The names and email addresses entered in this journal site will be used exclusively for the stated purposes of this journal and will not be made available for any other purpose or to any other party., Peer review (also known as refereeing) is the process of subjecting an author's scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field. It requires a community of experts in a given (and often narrowly defined) field who are qualified and able to perform impartial reviews. Likewise, it also refers to the work done while screening submitted manuscripts and funding applications. This normative process encourages authors to meet the accepted standards of their discipline. It prevents disseminating unwarranted claims, unacceptable interpretations, and personal views. Peer review increases the probability that weaknesses will be identified and fixed. For both grant funding and publication in a scholarly journal, it is also usually required that the subject be both novel and substantial.\\n\\nReviewers and editors are responsible for providing a constructive and prompt evaluation of submitted research papers based on the significance of their contribution and the rigors of analysis and presentation.\\n\\nThere are two or three referees for a given article. Two are experts on the topic, and one is an expert in research and statistics who shall review the technical components of the research. These referees revert the evaluation of the work that indicates the observed weaknesses or problems along with suggestions for improvement. The board then evaluates the referees' comments and notes the opinion of the manuscript before passing the decision with the referees' comments back to the author(s)., RMRJ makes it a point of adhering to COPE's Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing, and we encourage our publishing partners to do the same.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Cinnamomum cebuense (Kosterm.) is widely known as stomachache remedy, but adverse reaction to varying amount of herbal extract has also been reported, thus, requiring toxicity-profiling studies. Here, the toxicity of C. cebuense leaf extract (CCLE) was evaluated using brine shrimp lethality assay (BSLA) and anthelminthic assay under a complete randomized design with equal replications. Results in BSLA revealed an LC50 value of 7.05 Î¼g/ml (pâ‰¤0.05) which is considerably medium-toxic based on standard toxicity criterion. Influence on earthworm activity showed significant difference (pâ‰¤0.01) among the different concentrations of the extract (100 mg/ml, 75 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, and 25 mg/ml) following a concentration-dependent response trend. Results suggest strong toxicity against earthworms at 75â€“100 mg/ml while having a moderate to weak toxicity at 25â€“50mg/ml. Both assays were able to elucidate toxicity of CCLE which may be due to the presence of cinnamaldehyde, the main phytochemical found in cinnamon leaves. CCLE is toxic at elevated dosages and thus warrants parallel studies using higher-vertebrate models. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/625',\n",

       "  'text': 'The outbreak of the COVID-19 has brought about tiring tasks and unending demands in the Philippine educational system. With the abrupt shift of the teaching-learning process, teachers are pressured and stressed, which leads them to be burned out. The descriptive correlational research design determines the direct and indirect effects of perceived control to burnout through teachersâ€™ personality traits of the 240 early childhood teachers. Data are analyzed using the Pearson r formula, Bivariate parametric correlation, and the Structural Equation Model (SEM). The study reveals that despite the challenges experienced in this time of pandemic, teachers have control over themselves and with the people around them. The teachersâ€™ level of control does not influence their burnout; instead, their burnout is dependent on their emotional stability. Thus, burnout is a personal choice which is triggered by oneâ€™s emotion. A person with high perceived control may still be burned out if he does not have control over his emotions. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/964',\n",

Consequently, this indicates the necessity of developing an awareness and a comprehensive knowledge among the role of various stakeholders in their contribution to construction health and safety improvement. As part of the construction industry stakeholders, the role of localities is one of the factors to consider in the formation of construction health and safety knowledge and practice. Despite the plethora of construction health and safety studies found in the literature, there have been very few studies that have considered the association between localities and their association with construction health and safety practices. In this paper, a Chi-square test of independence is used to investigate whether a disparity between localities and their safety practices exists. Moreover, this study contributes to existing literature in such a way that it is the first to consider the relationship between intra-locality and health and safety practices in the context of the construction industry. Furthermore, this study will be valuable for construction stakeholders in the formulation of a more unified and standardized health and safety practices and regulations. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/587',\n",

Eight beam samples, with dimensions of 160 mm x 150 mm x 1400 mm are loaded and simulated under a four-point loading test until failure using a reaction framework machine. A camera is fixed at the center front view of the concrete beams to capture the deflection of the samples while testing. In each test, a dial indicator is installed and the maximum deflection is manually recorded. Based on the results, the maximum deflection values recorded by the proposed application obtained an average error of 18.38 % when compared to the manual measured results.

There are four modelled scenarios based on the combination of interruptible load program and the time-of-use scheme. The scenarios were modelled using a Binary Particle Swarm Optimization and were simulated using Matlab v6. In all the scenarios, this model successfully optimizes the battery dispatch scheduling while simultaneously minimizes the DUâ€™s penalty from exceeding the maximum allowable power demand. This algorithm also optimizes the linearly forecasted demand for the next six year for all the scenarios. Then, an economic analysis for the possible investment to the combined BESS and PV system is conducted through the comparison of the payback periods of each scenario. The first scenario is implemented without ILP and a ToU scheme and has 79.86 payback years. With ILP scheme only, the second scenario has 33.37 payback years. Then the third scenario with ToU scheme only has a 30.29 payback years. Finally, the fourth scenario, with both ILP and ToU schemes, shows the fastest recovery of the investment with 21.57 payback years. Thus the combination of both ILP and ToU schemes provide the best economic benefit.

Facilitating conditions do not affect the users' attitudes towards using the e-learning tool, which confirmed the effective utilization of GF-LP in online distance learning. The relationships between the original constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) were also presented. This study recommends the use of GF-LP or its features for remote learning. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/955\",\n",

While this may seem a valiant opening for a welcoming era on an epistemological standpoint, it does not however do away with its own paradoxes. I contend whether this fits well with postmodernism and its ironic relationship to truth and asserts further that the conditions for Nietzscheâ€™s perspectivism can only achieve its future if it hermeneutically stands as political consensus.

It utilized multiple factors that can be useful for policy and investment decisions and are intended to complement analyses using financial poverty indicators. Using exploratory data analysis, several indicators were selected to represent the different dimensions of poverty. Said indicators were then subjected to factor analysis which yielded four multidimensional indices namely: General Welfare Index, Governance and Emotional Landscape Index, and Social Climate Index. Singapore, Brunei, and Malaysia ranked 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in all three indices, respectively. In addition, multivariate cluster analysis was also performed. It revealed that Singapore exhibited exceptional performance in all indices, thereby earning it a cluster all to its own. Similarities were observed between Brunei and Malaysia while Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, and Indonesia were clustered together. Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar belonged to another cluster, indicating similarities among them.

The present investigation was conducted in three barangays in Northwestern Cagayan covering Culao, Sitio Nagbaranganan in Centro 2 and Balingit from March 2014 to April 2015. Â The study used a descriptive survey method to identify the diversity of melliferous resources and to develop a floral calendar in relation to pollen and nectar availability in the area. Data was analyzed using a frequency count. Â In the three vegetations sampled, 54 plant species are useful to honeybees, 27 of which are forest trees, 25 are agricultural crops, and one each is a shrub and a weed. The study ascertained 18 flowering plants as extremely important bee floras since these blossom throughout the year. March to May were identified as the honey flow periods.Â  July to September (dry season) and October to December (rainy season) were the dearth periods for honeybees in the study area. A floral calendar was developed based on the characteristics, abundance, time and duration of bloom of the bee flora.

       "  'text': 'Tambal Binisaya refers to the folk medicine used in Iligan City, Philippines. These medicines have been used for decades by mananambals or local folk healers and residents from low-income groups. However, because of modern treatments, the locals have started to move away from Tambal Binisaya. Because of this, many residents have become unfamiliar to Tambal Binisaya and the terms used in the trade. Thus, this ethnolinguistic study looked into the lexicon of Tambal Binisaya, specifically word formation processes involved in the names of these folk medicines. In doing so, the researcher employed interviews, observations and field notes in data gathering. Based on the results of the study, it was found that the morphological processes used are: affixation, enclitization, reduplication, metanalysis, compounding, blending, borrowing and coining. It is concluded that there indeed lies a rich trove of lexical items in Tambal Binisaya which should be given more societal and academic attention. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/748',\n",

Considering this thought, each country implements different strategies and national policies to support the development of renewable sources. However, these emerging developments may contribute to its depletion of natural sources. In this paper, an exploratory pattern analysis was used on 125 selected countries to determine the underlying trends on the effect of the development of renewable energy (RE) sources while utilizing the countriesâ€™ natural resources. Due to different status of each country, the trends were grouped in similar associations such as negative, positive and bell-like relationships. Developed countries showed a negative relationship where the natural resources are heavily utilized in the early stages but rapidly decreased as the RE progresses. This reflects the capability of these countries with high to very-high human development index (HDI) to invest more on advanced technologies which utilize fewer natural resources. On the other hand, the underdeveloped countries with low to moderate HDI behave in a positive relationship showing their heavily dependence on its natural resources as RE progresses. Moreover, a group of developing countries between developed and underdeveloped categories and without direct relationship to HDI showed a transition between positive to negative transition as the RE progresses.\\n\\nThese findings support the international policymakers, developers and investors on RE market justifications and entrustments, and fair RE policies such as the integration of Carbon Footprint Policy. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/173',\n",

The researcher utilized a descriptive correlational design to identify patterns of relationship that existed between the variables and to measure the strength of the relationship, which in this case involved the individual variables (educational attainment, health status, employment status, and presence of stressors), family variables (marital status, family size, family income, quality of family relationship, and family support) and social characteristics (social relationships, church attendance, access to amenities/ transportation, safe environment and community participation) and the level of subjective wellbeing among the elderly. The study was conducted in the municipality of Sagbayan, Bohol, Philippines. The researcher utilized a self-made questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Scale, Spiritual Wellbeing Scale and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) to gather the needed information relevant to the variables under study. Multiple regression and analysis of variance through the SPSS software were utilized in the treatment and analysis of the data. It was found out that the mean level of subjective wellbeing among elderly falls under the average level of life satisfaction which means that the elderlies are generally satisfied with the different aspects of their lives but there are certain domains that they would very much like to improve. The study also revealed that the significant predictive variables for the elderliesâ€™ subjective wellbeing include age, health status, perceived stress, community participation, family income, and neighborhood safety.

However, studies about its application on the hydroponic system of production on high valued crops are limited. Hence, the present study assessed the effect of magnetically-treated water on the growth and yield parameters of lettuce in hydroponic system. Magnetic device with different number of permanent magnets was used to magnetize irrigation water in the hydroponic system. Uniform and healthy seedlings are transplanted and arranged completely randomized design. Magnetically treated water enhanced the growth and yield parameters of lettuce such as weekly height, leaf area, fresh weight, and root length. The height, leaf area, fresh weight, and root length increased up to 44.30%, 199.93%, 50.72%, and 37.00%, respectively vs. the control. Results revealed that magnetic treatment for water in hydroponic system has potentials to increase the growth of lettuce and consequently its yield. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/772',\n",

Tests were made on the individual efficacy of botanical extracts like plant growth promoter (PGP) and oriental herb nutrient (OHN), as well as the Trichoderma harzianum Rifai as a possible biocontrol agent against major fungal tamarind diseases. Using Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD), a field setup was established with five treatments: untreated (negative control), synthetic fungicide, OHN, PGP, and T. harzianum having three replications per treatment. Results revealed that T. harzianum is an effective biocontrol agent against major fungal tamarind diseases. PGP having similar efficiency with T. harzianum significantly inhibited the infection and provided immediate defense from diseases. OHN is less effective due to delayed reduced infection.

Quantitative and qualitative research methods were used to collate a survey that would sure mend the study. With comprehensive computation of the random datasets, almost every Senior High School student achieved a satisfactory rating in both the Perceptions and Abilities Categories. A Chi-Square Statistic was also used and yielded maximum values which consequently, resulted to low p-values, suggesting the negation of the studyâ€™s null hypothesis. The result is further supported using the correlation statistic which corresponds to a high correlation between the studentsâ€™ Perceptions and Abilities in their speaking competence. The outcome of the summary of all competencies show that the Linguistic Competence contributed the most to the overall language intents of the students with sociolinguistic competence giving the least, which results in Linguistic Competence being the widely used language competency and sociolinguistic as not often practiced language skill amongst the students. With this, the Senior High School students are far more competent in phonetics, pronunciation, Phonology, Morphology, Syntax and Semantics rather than on the socio-cultural languages such as vocabulary, politeness and language style. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/183',\n",

Its traditional practice of consensus and consultation poses a challenge and as a factor in lagging behind the development of its implementation. But what state from among the ten members is the best candidate to lead the organization remained to be a question. This research explores the possibility of determining the potential leader of the organization by considering several variables like corruption perception index, global competitiveness, government effectiveness, GNI, etc. and utilized the process known as exploratory data analysis or data mining in gathering data. Data gathered were then processed through the use of statistical software to cluster the variables. Cluster analysis was then performed to establish relevant relationships, similarities, or differences of the data collected. Results and data gathered from several relevant studies about the topic were also collectively analyzed to determine the gap of perspectives from other notable scholars and to gain new insights to fill in that gap. Based on this method of analysis, it was revealed that thereâ€™s a single country that stands out from the rest and is the best candidate to lead the ASEAN Integration.

This study examined the relationship between auditors’ professional skepticism (PS) and thinking styles (TS) and explored what associations exist among PS, TS, and auditors’ sociodemographic attributes. Using snowball sampling, we surveyed 139 auditors in the Philippines using the Thinking Styles Inventory – Revised II and the Professional Skepticism Scale. Confirmatory analysis using Kendall’s tau-B showed a strong correlation between PS and TS I (creativity-generating style), implying that it plays a prominent role in professional skepticism. Contrary to earlier studies, our study found only a moderate correlation between TS II (norm-favoring style) and PS. The k-Modes clustering algorithm revealed that auditors showing high PS were low-ranking, less-experienced licensed female CPAs in firms with global affiliations and manifesting creative-generating TS. These findings add to the accounting profession’s understanding of PS and may be of valuable help in cultivating PS among auditors. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1320',\n",

Considering that the development of research culture is highly influenced by the paradigm by which institutions operate on, this paper sought to identify the configuration of the research culture. The researcher conducted a narrative inquiry with key informants from seven reputable teacher education institutions in Region VII and coded the interview transcripts with the aid of NVIVO 11.3.2. Using Thematic Analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006), three overarching themes on the configuration of the research culture, with its corresponding attributes and characteristics, were identified. The results showed that the research culture consists of observable and measurable inputs and outputs that interact in internal and external dynamics that are developmental and systemic, leading to standardized and contextualized practices in a teacher education institution. Therefore, research culture is an investment, a process, and a norm as it is evidence-based, dynamic, and distinct to the academic institution. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/861',\n",

Government effectiveness (GE) and corruption control (CC) are the direct predictors and independent variables while global competitiveness (GC) is the response variable. The determined causal factors affected by government effectiveness and corruption control are human development (HD) and enabling trade facilitation (ETF) which have varied impacts to global competitiveness. The researcher utilized a path analysis where 6 path models were established from the predictors (x) to its response variable (y) to determine which among these factors creates a huge impact. Path coefficients were generated and the summation of value effects was determined. Findings revealed that government effectiveness and corruption control were substantial elements that influenced the dynamism and vitality of global competitiveness landscape. However, GE has a strong direct effect to GC as compared to CC and from amongst the indirect effects, the correlation between GE and HD relative to GC has the highest path coefficient.

On the other hand, kiln drying may avoid these circumstances. However, smoke deposits in the finished product still cause farmers to have low-quality grade copra. Keeping this in view, an indirect heat copra dryer with phase changer (IHCDPC) was designed, fabricated, and evaluated in the hopes of providing farmers an alternative approach in drying copra, which may yield to producing a high-quality grade product. The developed IHCDPC was able to reduce the moisture content in fresh coconut meat from 57.4% w.b. to about 7.2% w.b. for a drying time of twenty-five hours. The IHCDPC was found out to have a thermal efficiency of 30.87%.

While, NEA serves as a powerful classroom diagnostic assessment to identify the skills of the students. It enables the teacher to devise and apply more appropriate teaching strategies and procedures that ignite the studentsâ€™ interest towards the subject. Out of the 179-students participating in the action research project, we discover that most of the error patterns are due to lack of understanding and transformation skills in solving word problems. With this result, the students encounter language difficulty and immature computational skills. To this end, the investigation and remediation of common math errors was a success in improving and achieving the learning goals and promotes positive behavioral changes towards the subject.

Sex differences in the occurrence of depressive symptoms have likewise been extensively reported in literature. However, a great majority of related research have primarily been carried out in the Western context. Hence, we conducted a study to identify the prevalence of depressive symptoms among Malaysian adolescents, and to determine its relationship with certain risk factors as well as the potential moderating role of sex. The sample comprised 964 adolescents from 20 secondary schools across Malaysia. Using logistic regression, results demonstrated that stressful life events and maternal verbal aggression significantly predicted symptoms of depression. In the moderation tests, sex significantly interacted with stressful life events and parental verbal aggression in predicting depressive symptoms. Hence, there is evidence to suggest that the depressogenic impact of stressful life events and parental verbal aggression on depressive symptomatology differs between male and female adolescents. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/680',\n",

This is performed initially by developing an actual setup calibrated though the comparison with the hypothesized values. Then, an experiment on this calibrated setup generates the measurement results of varying the displacement positions and the illumination levels. Through descriptive and comparative statistical analysis, there is evidence that the variations of the displacement alone do not significantly change the measurement results. Similarly, the variations in the illumination levels do not also constitute significant changes on the measurement results. Hence, each of the variables bears no contribution on the occurrence of the measurement error of using camera. It is further confirmed through the two way analysis of variance that there is no significant difference on the displacement positions and illumination levels, and on their interactions.

Factor analysis is utilized in extracting the following factor loadings for macro-context: a) lack of assistance from more knowledgeable others, b) unconducive-to-learning environment, c) cultural influence, d) poor feedback mechanism, e) insufficient resources, and f) low quality of the self-learning kit. Micro-context factors constitute the following: a) lack of exposure and practice, b) lack of perceived competence, c) lack of motivation and d) lack of interest. Students employed self-regulated strategies and managed to overcome these challenges through a) commitment to practice the skill, b) self-evaluation strategies, and c) social strategies.

Data on the various variables were gathered from statistical reports from various reputable world agencies and subjected to statistical analysis in order to determine their significance in relation to drug trafficking.Â Of the three dimensions analyzed in this study, only economic and social factors show relationship to drug trafficking. Rich countries have less corruption; thus, they have better law-enforcement. As a result, they register more drug trafficking apprehensions. Corrupt countries however, have lower apprehensions; thus, registering a lower drug trafficking rate. Poor countries register higher corruption index and lesser apprehensions of illegal drugs. To fight drug trafficking, it is important to eradicate corruption in order to gain ground in the fight against drugs.The lone dimension that shows no relationship is the political dimension such as restrictive and non-restrictive government policies on drugs.

Accordingly, Catholic education aims to provide an integral formation with a religious dimension that will equip the human person to become life, work, and mission ready and attain salvation. But given the contemporary socio-economic, cultural, political, and technological milieus characterized by a secular and consumerist view and praxis, the value of Catholic education may have been obscured or affected.Â  Thus, this paper aims to investigate and analyze the views and practices of the faculty of a Catholic University about Catholic education. The purposive sampling method was used to determine the participants in the study. Using a qualitative research design, the data were gathered from the participants using the face-to-face interview method. Aided by the phenomenological method, the findings discovered semblance in the participants' views and practices of Catholic education with that of Catholic Church. Despite the observed undesirable elements that obscure and marginalize it, Catholic education faithfully remains a Catholic. But making religion as the core of the curriculum of Catholic education is still a great challenge for Catholic schools to realize.

To achieve this aim, I employ Ricoeurâ€™s hermeneutics of symbols because in his different political essays, he consistently regards political power as akin to a symbol. Thus, for him, the critical appropriation of political power requires a hermeneutical procedure. And so in my discussion, I devote one section for Ricoeurâ€™s hermeneutics of symbols, one for his thoughts on political power, and another one for the critical appropriation of political power through the hermeneutics of symbols. To put Ricoeurâ€™s political and hermeneutical thoughts in a better light, I introduce these sections with a separate section on his philosophical anthropology. In my conclusion, I affirm that transforming political structures into just institutions is very much possible through the critical appropriation of political power. It is such a potential tool in effecting these transformations because the critical appropriation of political power involves a hermeneutical procedure that follows a three-step process of reflection. And reflection, which makes way for the critical appropriation of political power, is what ensures that power rests only in the hands of those who are more likely to advance the common good, resulting into a greater possibility for the transformation of political structures into just institutions. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/387',\n",

A modeling and simulation strategy has been employed in this paper predicting the impact of higher education market to the labor market. Results indicated that with the rapid expansion of the Higher Education(HE) market, the size of the higher education labor force will inevitably expand.The labor market tolerates a maximum expansion capacity for HE graduates beyond which the excess HE graduates will bifurcate into two (2) channels of productive sector, namely: (a) the creation of new economies or (b) the integration of HE graduates into the skilled labor force. This dynamics necessarily yields a highly fragmented labor force configuration. In essence, the evolution of the labor market is a replica of Darwinâ€™s Biological Theory of Evolution where only the fittest will survive, i.e. evolution through mutation and adaptation whose equivalent concepts in this setting are â€œinnovationâ€ and â€œadaptationâ€ respectively. It is well-established in Evolutionary Biology that â€œmutationâ€ is the shortest-route to evolution and so we posit that â€œinnovationâ€ is the shortest route to the labor market evolutionary ladder.Therefore, a good university must be able to produce graduates who are innovative and adaptive at the same time to survive in a competitive labor market. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/18',\n",

First, to show a new, direct method of trisecting the 900 angle using unmarked straight edge and compass; secondly, to show Bhaskaraâ€™s first proof of the Pythagorean theorem (c2 = a2 + b2) as embedded in this new, direct trisection of the 900 angle; lastly, to show the derivation of the Pythagorean theorem from this trisection of the 900 angle. This paper employs the direct dissection method. It concludes by presenting four points: a) the concept of trisectability as distinct from concept of constructability; b) the trisection of the 900 angle as really a new, different method; c) Bhaskaraâ€™s first proof of the Pythagorean theorem as truly embedded in this trisection of the 900 angle and; d) another way of deriving Pythagorean theorem from this trisection of the 900 angle. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/987',\n",

Increasing atmospheric temperature had changed the dynamics of the mosquito habitats and thereby influences distribution of these mosquito vectors. We examined the increase in the number of countries within the regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas reporting laboratory confirmed dengue cases caused by DENV-1 as a response to increasing global surface temperature difference. Data on the number of countries with confirmed reports of dengue (Messina et al. 2014) and surface temperature difference (General Circulation Model) were subjected to scatter plots and linear regression. There were 113 recorded countries across three regions (America=44, comprising the North and South; Africa=28; and Asia=41) reporting dengue incidence from 1943 to 2013, of which 98 countries (America=41; Africa=20; and Asia=37 with the inclusion of Australia) reported confirmed dengue cases caused by DENV-1. Findings suggest that the effect of temperature to the expansion of dengue varies dramatically in certain groups of country. Here, we explore three patterns (PAT) of expansion response where 1) continuous increase in temperature results into a continuous increase in the number of countries with dengue cases (PAT-A), 2) initial increase in temperature results into increase in the number of countries with dengue cases but subsequent increase in temperature results in the decline of dengue expansion (PAT-B), and 3) initial increase in temperature results into higher rate of dengue expansion but continued increase slows it down (PAT-C). PAT-A represented the majority of these countries, including 10 out of 11 countries in Southeast Asia. These results are in congruence with the past studies that supports dengue expansion to be temperature-dependent. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/121',\n",

Guava and avocado extract showed almost all the secondary metabolites screened while only flavonoids and alkaloids were present in the malunggay extract. The presence of secondary metabolites applied to broiler chicks as feed additives enhances the growth performance of the chicken.

It practically covers the gaps between cash outflows and inflows from a countryâ€™s revenues such as those coming from taxes. However, when a countryâ€™s debt goes too high that it already has difficulty in paying it off, sovereign bankruptcy occurs. This study dwells at the factors that lead to sovereign bankruptcy among ASEAN countries in terms of business confidence, credit management, resource availability and market stability. To measure the indicators in determining the nations in the verge of being bankrupt, the researchers use the data depicting the corruption perception index, GDP and investment climate index. Furthermore, data regarding the ease of doing business rankings, credit ratings, surplus/deficit of the government budget, external debt, current account balance and inflation rate are also considered. These indicators are believed to be suggestive of a countryâ€™s capability of sustaining its overall debt, highlighting the point that an ASEAN country should take into account all its resources to ensure that it doesnâ€™t go bankrupt as a nation especially now that it is looking into integrating itself into one economic ASEAN community. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/27',\n",

Findings provide implications towards improving an online websiteâ€™s shopping platform which may motivate the consumer to buy. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/304',\n",

       "  'text': 'In the Philippines, the installation of solar panels on the rooftops of residential and commercial buildings has increased in popularity. Even if the country has high solar insolation, energy conversion is still inefficient since the solar panel arrays are not always facing in perpendicular to the sun. Technologies related to increasing the solar panel efficiency such as solar trackers are usually complex and expensive. This problem is addressed by designing a low cost dual axis solar tracker with the integration of specular reflector system. The dual axis tracker system can move the panel and the reflector assembly in a precise and controlled manner to ensure maximum output. This was achieved by using a LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) compass assembly, gear system, and stepper motor mechanism. To measure the solar panel output, a voltage sensing circuit was incorporated instead of using the existing optical and time-based techniques. The system performance was tested in both the controlled and the actual environments. Experimental data have shown that when the panel is perpendicular to the light source, the system yields maximum energy. The need for a tracking and planar reflector system is notably important when the light source moves away from the normal because this results to a significant drop of the panelâ€™s average efficiency. The addition of the tracker alone had greater enhancement effect than with the specular reflector only. The tracker boosts the efficiency by 69.55% while the specular reflector boosts it by only 15.12%. Combining the tracker and the specular reflector yields the best result with a 92.33% boost on the average efficiency. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/210',\n",

Four variables revealed to be independent indicators of high or poor CRM participation: the stakeholdersâ€™ locality income class, age, level of education, and household size. These indicators are important matters to cogitate for they are indirect drivers of the success or failure of CRM activities. It is concluded that Bataan CRM in the Philippines needs to be reviewed to tackle socio-economic barriers to engagement. Assessment of the process of selecting Bataan CRM participants; strengthened information, education, and communication component through an enriched content and rationalized delivery; institution of a unified CRM database system; and establishment of a provincial CRM research center are all recommended to counteract stakeholder estrangement and unresponsiveness to CRM efforts. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/324',\n",

It assessed the profitability of rice ratooning to the abovementioned objectives. The experiment was set out in a split-plot organized in a Randomized Complete Block Design with production management practices as the main plot and cutting heights of ratoon crop as the subplot treatment. Production management practices notably affected all agronomic characteristics, yield, and yield component parameters evaluated except the grain yield. Cutting height remarkably influenced all growth and yield parameters tested except panicle weight. Economic analysis revealed that the improved method achieved a higher gross margin (PHP21,321.60) than the farmerâ€™s practice (PHP15,419.40) because of the formerâ€™s high productivity (1.64 t ha-1). A cutting height of 45.0 cm under the improved method obtained the highest gross margin (PHP28,677.00).

This paper attempts to develop a model that could predict how many years a facility (private or government) would last based on the given number of assumptions and random data. The study used an experimental design using simulation modeling. Assumptions were formulated to measure different variables. Findings revealed that government facilities tend to deteriorate faster compared to its private counterparts. Government facilities would only last approximately up to six (6) years then reach its critical level. This is due to the assumption that only 40% of government institutions are effective workers. Low percentage of effective workers would translate to less motivation of the worker to pursue any transaction that could possibly help the current state of the facility. On the other hand, more than half of the Private facilities would last more than five years before reaching a critical level. This is due to the assumption that private workers are 20% higher compared to government workers in terms of percentage of effective workers. A highly motivated worker will always be willing to spend time, even extra time, to perform his job. Benign neglect of a less motivated workforce would result to non performance of his assigned task. Therefore, increasing the level of motivation of an employee is the primordial concern of every organization whether private or public because an increase of well motivated and effective workforce would encourage everyone to help maintain and to extend the life of every facility. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/26',\n",

Fourteen key informants were identified with the aid of two sampling methods- snowball technique and purposive sampling. Open-ended questionnaires were employed to obtain authentic and significant information from the key informants. An inventory on the knowledge on the wild edible and medicinal insects in the study areas is presented here. Results showedthat these key informants profusely utilized wide range of biological resources in diverse ways, and thus contribute to their daily activities. As a whole, the factors that influenced their entomological practices include their socio-demographic and educational background, accessibility to urban societies and the open availability of certain resources particularly the insects they use and the influence brought about by their family and community. Moreover, these informants had different insects used in their practices, and they had their ways of preparing and administering these as medicines and food. Regardless of these differences, all of them were able to perceive that the insects used as medicine and food were equally beneficial to them.Traditional knowledge regardingentomotherapy and entomophagy in Cebu is very essential since folk medicine is still one of the most important resources for food and discovery of unknown natural drug resources.

Applying one of Herbert Blumerâ€™s assumptions on symbolic interactionism, this study further argues that the meaning of knowledge sharing as a form of communication among research academics could be found in the process by which the academics interact symbolically with others within and outside the academic community.

It described first-hand real-life experiences of the suicide-loss survivors to determine the contexts, reasons, and implications of suicide and recommend community-based intervention strategies. Purposive-criterion and convenient sampling methods were used to determine the respondents. Focused group discussion and in-depth interviews were conducted to gather data analyzed using Braun & Clarkeâ€™s six-phase guide. The findings revealed that the life experiences of the respondents are characterized by regret, pain, and bereavement. Suicides were committed due to dysfunctional families, economic hardships, breakdown of relationships, and drug abuse. The pain of suicide affected both the victim and their survivors and occurs within the psychosocial sphere. Interventions should therefore employ a familial, communitarian, and inter-institutional approach. Local Government Units (LGUs) are recommended to initiate a reach-out community-based suicide intervention program and debriefing services. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1206',\n",

The industry contributes US$17.6 billion through exports in 2012. At present, the demand for crude palm oil has soared high due to the increasing awareness of the varied uses of palm oil. The challenge to countries cultivating oil palm is how to cope with the local and global demand .The focus now is to increase plantation areas to produce a higher volume of crude oil to serve the needs of the world market. Today, the total land area planted to oil palm in Indonesia has reached 9.7 million hectares. This study used data mining and Delphi technique. Data were sourced from public domain websites and several databases. This study determined the gap between production and utilization and to provide information to existing industry players ,policy makers, future investors, and would-be entrants to the industry on the latest trends noting the fast development of the industry not only in Indonesia but also in other Southeast Asian countries. Although Indonesia has been successful in providing the local and international market with palm oil products and palm derivatives, it has to benchmark with other palm producing countries to avoid industry stagnation and to intensify diversification particularly in the development of new edible products to take advantage of the health benefits derived from the use of palm oil. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/28',\n",

The van Kaam method popularized by Moustakas was used to analyze the data gathered. Five major themes emerged: recognizing the child's needs, surviving hardships, enduring exhaustion, encountering silver linings, and moving forward. The findings showed that fathers of children with autism encountered challenging and fulfilling events during the pandemic with resilience. Fathers of children with autism prioritized familial needs, especially of the child, and increased their presence in the household.

Five themes emerged describing the impact of GBE on the cognitive domain of learning, namely, 1) experiential learning, 2) meaningful learning, 3) explicit and implicit learning, 4) discovery learning, and 5) transmissible learning. GBE is a successful program in most of the basic education curriculum integration contributing to the improvement of academic performance.

For one century now, this language has become dominant in the Filipino consciousness. Linguistically, it has even influenced the classification of the vocabulary of the Visayan-Cebuano language, i.e., according to the English eight parts of speech. But, as early as 1947, Manuel Yap, bishop and biblical scholar from Carcar, Cebu, objected, saying that the Visayan-Cebuano vocabulary does not fit in the English eight-parts-of-speech classification. This study, then, aims at inquiring into Yapâ€™s own classification of the Visayan-Cebuano vocabulary. In doing this, it uses the descriptive-analysis research design.

These issues may be complex but their antidote is contrarily simple. An answer is found in Immanuel Kantâ€™s thought on moral culture which pertains to three essential features, namely: obedience, truthfulness, and sociableness. This qualitative research focuses on the fundamental ideas in the section on moral culture in Kantâ€™s On Education. As my contribution to the fund of knowledge, I proceed by establishing the implications and antitheses of the three features of Kantâ€™s moral culture. A discussion on obedience differentiates its two kinds: absolute and voluntary. Absolute obedience is the result of compulsion by a command, while voluntary obedience is the result of confidence by a reasonable will. It is impossible to think of character formation without also thinking of truthfulness. Kant asserts that a man who tells lies has no character. Sociableness emphasizes on the importance of building relationships and friendships. The researcher contends that these three features of moral culture have corresponding antitheses: violation of laws of the land for obedience; lying and dishonesty (highest form is corruption in politics) for truthfulness; and human rights violation (highest form is war) for sociableness. Finally, these features are imperative in forging peace and social order which usher to a kind of development that people aspire. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/112', 'author': 'Albert Albina', 'title': 'Moral Culture in Kantâ€™s On Education (1803): Implications and Antitheses', 'date': '2015-12-03 December 03 2015'}, 1: {'uuid': 'ce671fe9-d621-4c12-ad10-e98b072943c6', 'text': 'The importance of studentâ€™s evaluation for promotion leads teachers to be lenient in exchange of a good evaluation result.Â  This study looks into the possible effects of midterm grades to the evaluation results of teachers at the end of the semester.Â  The study utilized data mining approach using midterm grades and evaluation results of full-time and part-time faculty members.Â  Both parametric and non-parametric analyses were employed in the study.

She is committed to editorial independence, diversity, and equity. Submissions from people of different backgrounds and geographic locations are welcome. Submissions are assigned to editors who will do the initial review. Should the manuscript be suitable for consideration by RMRJ, the paper will be sent to at least two independent peer reviewers. The peer reviewers' assessments are used to inform the associate editor's decision on whether or not to recommend publication. Endorsed papers will be forwarded to the Chief Editor for final approval. \\n\\nWe do not put up with rude behavior or letters directed at our editors, staff, or other people helping us publish.

Otherwise, the manuscript is returned to the author(s).\\nThe referees' evaluations include an explicit recommendation of what to do with the manuscript, chosen from options provided by the journal. Most recommendations are along the following lines:\\n\\nAccept without revisions\\nAccept with minor revisions\\nAccept with major revisions\\nReject with the option to resubmit\\nReject\\nIn situations where the referees disagree substantially about the quality of work, there are several strategies for reaching a decision. When the editor receives positive and negative reviews for the same manuscript, the board will solicit one or more additional reviews as a tie-breaker. In the case of ties, the board may invite authors to reply to a referee's criticisms and permit a compelling rebuttal to break the tie. Suppose the editor does not feel confident in weighing the persuasiveness of a rebuttal. In that case, the board may solicit a response from the referee who made the original criticism. In rare instances, the board will convey communications between an author and a referee, thereby allowing them to debate on a point. Even in such a case, however, the board does not allow referees to confer with each other, and the goal of the process is explicitly not to reach a consensus or to convince anyone to change his/ her opinions., RMRJ welcomes submission of quality researches in any of the following academic domains:\\n\\nAccountancy, Business and Management, and Finance;\\nCommunication, Humanities, Psychology, and Religion;\\nEducation and Educational Management;\\nEngineering, Mathematics, Statistics, and Technology;\\nEnvironment, Health, and Natural Sciences;\\nPhilosophical and Mathematical Reviews; and\\nPolitics and Governance, and Social Sciences., RMRJ welcomes the submission of comments on previous articles. Comments on articles previously published in the journal will generally be reviewed by two reviewers, usually an author of the original article (to assist the editor in evaluating whether the submitted comment represents the previous article's accuracy) and an independent reviewer. The original author will be invited to reply if a comment is accepted for publication. All other editorial requirements, as enumerated above, apply to proposed comments., The names and email addresses entered in this journal site will be used exclusively for the stated purposes of this journal and will not be made available for any other purpose or to any other party., Peer review (also known as refereeing) is the process of subjecting an author's scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field. It requires a community of experts in a given (and often narrowly defined) field who are qualified and able to perform impartial reviews. Likewise, it also refers to the work done while screening submitted manuscripts and funding applications. This normative process encourages authors to meet the accepted standards of their discipline. It prevents disseminating unwarranted claims, unacceptable interpretations, and personal views. Peer review increases the probability that weaknesses will be identified and fixed. For both grant funding and publication in a scholarly journal, it is also usually required that the subject be both novel and substantial.\\n\\nReviewers and editors are responsible for providing a constructive and prompt evaluation of submitted research papers based on the significance of their contribution and the rigors of analysis and presentation.\\n\\nThere are two or three referees for a given article. Two are experts on the topic, and one is an expert in research and statistics who shall review the technical components of the research.

Additionally, RMRJ demands that writers include a statement about their funding. Additionally, editors and reviewers are expected to disclose any potential conflicting interests that can compromise the impartiality or integrity of a publication., The names and email addresses entered in this journal site will be used exclusively for the stated purposes of this journal and will not be made available for any other purpose or to any other party., All appeals and complaints are to be in writing and addressed to the Editor in Chief of the RMRJ. These concerns are to be addressed by the members of the RMRJ Editorial Board. Emails are to be sent to: recoletos_journal@usjr.edu.ph., Peer review (also known as refereeing) is the process of subjecting an author's scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field. It requires a community of experts in a given (and often narrowly defined) field who are qualified and able to perform impartial reviews. Likewise, it also refers to the work done while screening submitted manuscripts and funding applications. This normative process encourages authors to meet the accepted standards of their discipline. It prevents disseminating unwarranted claims, unacceptable interpretations, and personal views. Peer review increases the probability that weaknesses will be identified and fixed. For both grant funding and publication in a scholarly journal, it is also usually required that the subject be both novel and substantial.\\n\\nReviewers and editors are responsible for providing a constructive and prompt evaluation of submitted research papers based on the significance of their contribution and the rigors of analysis and presentation.\\n\\nThere are two or three referees for a given article. Two are experts on the topic, and one is an expert in research and statistics who shall review the technical components of the research. These referees revert the evaluation of the work that indicates the observed weaknesses or problems along with suggestions for improvement. The board then evaluates the referees' comments and notes the opinion of the manuscript before passing the decision with the referees' comments back to the author(s)., A manuscript is accepted when\\n\\nit is endorsed for publication by at least two referees,\\nit substantially complies with the instructions of the reviewers;\\nit complies with the ethical standards and protocols with studies involving humans and animals;\\nthe manuscript passed the plagiarism detection test with a score of at most 10% Similarity Index and a Grammarly Rating of 95% or more. Otherwise, the manuscript is returned to the author(s).\\nThe referees' evaluations include an explicit recommendation of what to do with the manuscript, chosen from options provided by the journal. Most recommendations are along the following lines:\\n\\nAccept without revisions\\nAccept with minor revisions\\nAccept with major revisions\\nReject with the option to resubmit\\nReject\\nIn situations where the referees disagree substantially about the quality of work, there are several strategies for reaching a decision. When the editor receives positive and negative reviews for the same manuscript, the board will solicit one or more additional reviews as a tie-breaker. In the case of ties, the board may invite authors to reply to a referee's criticisms and permit a compelling rebuttal to break the tie. Suppose the editor does not feel confident in weighing the persuasiveness of a rebuttal. In that case, the board may solicit a response from the referee who made the original criticism. In rare instances, the board will convey communications between an author and a referee, thereby allowing them to debate on a point. Even in such a case, however, the board does not allow referees to confer with each other, and the goal of the process is explicitly not to reach a consensus or to convince anyone to change his/ her opinions., All authors submitting their works to the RMRJ for publication as original articles attest that the submitted works represent their authors' contributions and have not been copied or plagiarized in whole or in part from other works.\\n\\nRMRJ adheres to COPE's first two requirements in defining authorship:  a. making a substantial contribution to the work and b. being accountable for the work and its published form. Substantial contribution includes revising the manuscript to include important intellectual content.\\n\\nCorresponding authors are to use their institutional email in the submission process. All contributing authors are to be declared upon submission. Their names, ORCID number, and affiliation are to be written on the cover page and submitted separately in the journal's portal as a separate file. Only authors whose names are found on the cover page upon submission are acknowledged as authors.   Individuals who do not meet the criteria for authorship may be mentioned in the Acknowledgements section of their publication., RMRJ is dedicated to promoting knowledge through high-quality research publications in various disciplines. She is committed to editorial independence, diversity, and equity. Submissions from people of different backgrounds and geographic locations are welcome. Submissions are assigned to editors who will do the initial review. Should the manuscript be suitable for consideration by RMRJ, the paper will be sent to at least two independent peer reviewers. The peer reviewers' assessments are used to inform the associate editor's decision on whether or not to recommend publication. Endorsed papers will be forwarded to the Chief Editor for final approval. \\n\\nWe do not put up with rude behavior or letters directed at our editors, staff, or other people helping us publish. We have the right to take appropriate measures to safeguard others from it. This situation may involve, for instance, withdrawing a manuscript from consideration or objecting to offensive remarks made by peers., RMRJ makes it a point of adhering to COPE's Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing, and we encourage our publishing partners to do the same., The RECOLETOS MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH JOURNAL (RMRJ) is committed to upholding the highest standards of publication ethics and takes all possible measures against publication malpractices. RMRJ commits herself to objective and fair double-blind peer-review of the submitted for publication works and to prevent any actual or potential conflict of interests between the editorial and review personnel and the reviewed material. Any departures from the stipulated guidelines should be reported directly to the Editor-in-Chief, who is unequivocally committed to providing swift resolutions to any such problems., RMRJ does not endorse significant publication overlap. When overlap is necessary, it is only permitted if the manuscript may advance the field of study, has the explicit endorsement of the original publication, and cites the original source. (Cambridge University Press, Version 4.0, September 20, 2021)., We reserve the right to review all contributions using proper plagiarism detection software, such as Turnitin. The journal permits a similarity rating of no more than 10%. Submissions that have more than the permitted rating will be rejected or given the option to resubmit. We will adhere to the procedures indicated in the Retractions section of these guidelines if plagiarism is found after publication. Any allegations of plagiarism should be reported to us by our readers, reviewers, and editors., RMRJ picks its reviewers through its editorial office. When a manuscript arrives, an editor solicits reviews from scholars or other experts to referee the manuscript. The identities of the referees selected by the Editorial Board are kept unknown to research authors. However, the reviewer's identity can be disclosed under some particular circumstances. Disclosure of Peer Review can be granted under the following grounds: as evidence to prove that the published paper underwent peer review as required by the University for ranking and financial incentives, for regulatory bodies such as the Commission on Higher Education, Accreditation of Academic Programs. Requests for peer review results shall be made in writing., RMRJ welcomes the submission of comments on previous articles. Comments on articles previously published in the journal will generally be reviewed by two reviewers, usually an author of the original article (to assist the editor in evaluating whether the submitted comment represents the previous article's accuracy) and an independent reviewer.

Consequently, this indicates the necessity of developing an awareness and a comprehensive knowledge among the role of various stakeholders in their contribution to construction health and safety improvement. As part of the construction industry stakeholders, the role of localities is one of the factors to consider in the formation of construction health and safety knowledge and practice. Despite the plethora of construction health and safety studies found in the literature, there have been very few studies that have considered the association between localities and their association with construction health and safety practices. In this paper, a Chi-square test of independence is used to investigate whether a disparity between localities and their safety practices exists. Moreover, this study contributes to existing literature in such a way that it is the first to consider the relationship between intra-locality and health and safety practices in the context of the construction industry.

Eight beam samples, with dimensions of 160 mm x 150 mm x 1400 mm are loaded and simulated under a four-point loading test until failure using a reaction framework machine. A camera is fixed at the center front view of the concrete beams to capture the deflection of the samples while testing. In each test, a dial indicator is installed and the maximum deflection is manually recorded. Based on the results, the maximum deflection values recorded by the proposed application obtained an average error of 18.38 % when compared to the manual measured results.

There are four modelled scenarios based on the combination of interruptible load program and the time-of-use scheme. The scenarios were modelled using a Binary Particle Swarm Optimization and were simulated using Matlab v6. In all the scenarios, this model successfully optimizes the battery dispatch scheduling while simultaneously minimizes the DUâ€™s penalty from exceeding the maximum allowable power demand. This algorithm also optimizes the linearly forecasted demand for the next six year for all the scenarios. Then, an economic analysis for the possible investment to the combined BESS and PV system is conducted through the comparison of the payback periods of each scenario. The first scenario is implemented without ILP and a ToU scheme and has 79.86 payback years. With ILP scheme only, the second scenario has 33.37 payback years. Then the third scenario with ToU scheme only has a 30.29 payback years. Finally, the fourth scenario, with both ILP and ToU schemes, shows the fastest recovery of the investment with 21.57 payback years.

This descriptive correlational study determined the level of optimism, job stress, and emotional exhaustion of 150 teachers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and it analyzed the relationship among these three variables. The data were analyzed using weighted mean, standard deviation, and Pearson r. Results revealed resiliency among teachers amidst the pandemic with a high level of optimism and a relatively low COVID-19 induced job stress and emotional exhaustion level. This study has also shown that optimism is not correlated with job stress and emotional exhaustion, but it found out significant relationship between the last two variables.

It utilized multiple factors that can be useful for policy and investment decisions and are intended to complement analyses using financial poverty indicators. Using exploratory data analysis, several indicators were selected to represent the different dimensions of poverty. Said indicators were then subjected to factor analysis which yielded four multidimensional indices namely: General Welfare Index, Governance and Emotional Landscape Index, and Social Climate Index. Singapore, Brunei, and Malaysia ranked 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in all three indices, respectively. In addition, multivariate cluster analysis was also performed. It revealed that Singapore exhibited exceptional performance in all indices, thereby earning it a cluster all to its own. Similarities were observed between Brunei and Malaysia while Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, and Indonesia were clustered together. Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar belonged to another cluster, indicating similarities among them.

Due to different status of each country, the trends were grouped in similar associations such as negative, positive and bell-like relationships. Developed countries showed a negative relationship where the natural resources are heavily utilized in the early stages but rapidly decreased as the RE progresses. This reflects the capability of these countries with high to very-high human development index (HDI) to invest more on advanced technologies which utilize fewer natural resources.

The researcher utilized a descriptive correlational design to identify patterns of relationship that existed between the variables and to measure the strength of the relationship, which in this case involved the individual variables (educational attainment, health status, employment status, and presence of stressors), family variables (marital status, family size, family income, quality of family relationship, and family support) and social characteristics (social relationships, church attendance, access to amenities/ transportation, safe environment and community participation) and the level of subjective wellbeing among the elderly. The study was conducted in the municipality of Sagbayan, Bohol, Philippines. The researcher utilized a self-made questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Scale, Spiritual Wellbeing Scale and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) to gather the needed information relevant to the variables under study. Multiple regression and analysis of variance through the SPSS software were utilized in the treatment and analysis of the data. It was found out that the mean level of subjective wellbeing among elderly falls under the average level of life satisfaction which means that the elderlies are generally satisfied with the different aspects of their lives but there are certain domains that they would very much like to improve. The study also revealed that the significant predictive variables for the elderliesâ€™ subjective wellbeing include age, health status, perceived stress, community participation, family income, and neighborhood safety. Implications of these results are noted for the development of programs and initiatives to enhance subjective wellbeing. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/116', 'author': 'Jose Arnold Tariga, Jezyl C.

A Chi-Square Statistic was also used and yielded maximum values which consequently, resulted to low p-values, suggesting the negation of the studyâ€™s null hypothesis. The result is further supported using the correlation statistic which corresponds to a high correlation between the studentsâ€™ Perceptions and Abilities in their speaking competence. The outcome of the summary of all competencies show that the Linguistic Competence contributed the most to the overall language intents of the students with sociolinguistic competence giving the least, which results in Linguistic Competence being the widely used language competency and sociolinguistic as not often practiced language skill amongst the students.

While, NEA serves as a powerful classroom diagnostic assessment to identify the skills of the students. It enables the teacher to devise and apply more appropriate teaching strategies and procedures that ignite the studentsâ€™ interest towards the subject. Out of the 179-students participating in the action research project, we discover that most of the error patterns are due to lack of understanding and transformation skills in solving word problems. With this result, the students encounter language difficulty and immature computational skills. To this end, the investigation and remediation of common math errors was a success in improving and achieving the learning goals and promotes positive behavioral changes towards the subject.

However, a great majority of related research have primarily been carried out in the Western context. Hence, we conducted a study to identify the prevalence of depressive symptoms among Malaysian adolescents, and to determine its relationship with certain risk factors as well as the potential moderating role of sex. The sample comprised 964 adolescents from 20 secondary schools across Malaysia. Using logistic regression, results demonstrated that stressful life events and maternal verbal aggression significantly predicted symptoms of depression. In the moderation tests, sex significantly interacted with stressful life events and parental verbal aggression in predicting depressive symptoms. Hence, there is evidence to suggest that the depressogenic impact of stressful life events and parental verbal aggression on depressive symptomatology differs between male and female adolescents. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/680', 'author': 'Sharisse May M.

This is performed initially by developing an actual setup calibrated though the comparison with the hypothesized values. Then, an experiment on this calibrated setup generates the measurement results of varying the displacement positions and the illumination levels. Through descriptive and comparative statistical analysis, there is evidence that the variations of the displacement alone do not significantly change the measurement results. Similarly, the variations in the illumination levels do not also constitute significant changes on the measurement results. Hence, each of the variables bears no contribution on the occurrence of the measurement error of using camera. It is further confirmed through the two way analysis of variance that there is no significant difference on the displacement positions and illumination levels, and on their interactions.

To achieve this aim, I employ Ricoeurâ€™s hermeneutics of symbols because in his different political essays, he consistently regards political power as akin to a symbol. Thus, for him, the critical appropriation of political power requires a hermeneutical procedure. And so in my discussion, I devote one section for Ricoeurâ€™s hermeneutics of symbols, one for his thoughts on political power, and another one for the critical appropriation of political power through the hermeneutics of symbols. To put Ricoeurâ€™s political and hermeneutical thoughts in a better light, I introduce these sections with a separate section on his philosophical anthropology. In my conclusion, I affirm that transforming political structures into just institutions is very much possible through the critical appropriation of political power. It is such a potential tool in effecting these transformations because the critical appropriation of political power involves a hermeneutical procedure that follows a three-step process of reflection. And reflection, which makes way for the critical appropriation of political power, is what ensures that power rests only in the hands of those who are more likely to advance the common good, resulting into a greater possibility for the transformation of political structures into just institutions. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/387', 'author': 'Alexis Deodato S.

Increasing atmospheric temperature had changed the dynamics of the mosquito habitats and thereby influences distribution of these mosquito vectors. We examined the increase in the number of countries within the regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas reporting laboratory confirmed dengue cases caused by DENV-1 as a response to increasing global surface temperature difference. Data on the number of countries with confirmed reports of dengue (Messina et al. 2014) and surface temperature difference (General Circulation Model) were subjected to scatter plots and linear regression. There were 113 recorded countries across three regions (America=44, comprising the North and South; Africa=28; and Asia=41) reporting dengue incidence from 1943 to 2013, of which 98 countries (America=41; Africa=20; and Asia=37 with the inclusion of Australia) reported confirmed dengue cases caused by DENV-1. Findings suggest that the effect of temperature to the expansion of dengue varies dramatically in certain groups of country. Here, we explore three patterns (PAT) of expansion response where 1) continuous increase in temperature results into a continuous increase in the number of countries with dengue cases (PAT-A), 2) initial increase in temperature results into increase in the number of countries with dengue cases but subsequent increase in temperature results in the decline of dengue expansion (PAT-B), and 3) initial increase in temperature results into higher rate of dengue expansion but continued increase slows it down (PAT-C). PAT-A represented the majority of these countries, including 10 out of 11 countries in Southeast Asia.

This study dwells at the factors that lead to sovereign bankruptcy among ASEAN countries in terms of business confidence, credit management, resource availability and market stability. To measure the indicators in determining the nations in the verge of being bankrupt, the researchers use the data depicting the corruption perception index, GDP and investment climate index. Furthermore, data regarding the ease of doing business rankings, credit ratings, surplus/deficit of the government budget, external debt, current account balance and inflation rate are also considered. These indicators are believed to be suggestive of a countryâ€™s capability of sustaining its overall debt, highlighting the point that an ASEAN country should take into account all its resources to ensure that it doesnâ€™t go bankrupt as a nation especially now that it is looking into integrating itself into one economic ASEAN community. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/27', 'author': 'Yener C.

Even if the country has high solar insolation, energy conversion is still inefficient since the solar panel arrays are not always facing in perpendicular to the sun. Technologies related to increasing the solar panel efficiency such as solar trackers are usually complex and expensive. This problem is addressed by designing a low cost dual axis solar tracker with the integration of specular reflector system. The dual axis tracker system can move the panel and the reflector assembly in a precise and controlled manner to ensure maximum output. This was achieved by using a LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) compass assembly, gear system, and stepper motor mechanism. To measure the solar panel output, a voltage sensing circuit was incorporated instead of using the existing optical and time-based techniques. The system performance was tested in both the controlled and the actual environments. Experimental data have shown that when the panel is perpendicular to the light source, the system yields maximum energy. The need for a tracking and planar reflector system is notably important when the light source moves away from the normal because this results to a significant drop of the panelâ€™s average efficiency. The addition of the tracker alone had greater enhancement effect than with the specular reflector only. The tracker boosts the efficiency by 69.55% while the specular reflector boosts it by only 15.12%. Combining the tracker and the specular reflector yields the best result with a 92.33% boost on the average efficiency. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/210', 'author': 'Teofrenz A.

Production management practices notably affected all agronomic characteristics, yield, and yield component parameters evaluated except the grain yield. Cutting height remarkably influenced all growth and yield parameters tested except panicle weight. Economic analysis revealed that the improved method achieved a higher gross margin (PHP21,321.60) than the farmerâ€™s practice (PHP15,419.40) because of the formerâ€™s high productivity (1.64 t ha-1).

This paper attempts to develop a model that could predict how many years a facility (private or government) would last based on the given number of assumptions and random data. The study used an experimental design using simulation modeling. Assumptions were formulated to measure different variables. Findings revealed that government facilities tend to deteriorate faster compared to its private counterparts. Government facilities would only last approximately up to six (6) years then reach its critical level. This is due to the assumption that only 40% of government institutions are effective workers. Low percentage of effective workers would translate to less motivation of the worker to pursue any transaction that could possibly help the current state of the facility. On the other hand, more than half of the Private facilities would last more than five years before reaching a critical level. This is due to the assumption that private workers are 20% higher compared to government workers in terms of percentage of effective workers. A highly motivated worker will always be willing to spend time, even extra time, to perform his job. Benign neglect of a less motivated workforce would result to non performance of his assigned task. Therefore, increasing the level of motivation of an employee is the primordial concern of every organization whether private or public because an increase of well motivated and effective workforce would encourage everyone to help maintain and to extend the life of every facility. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/26', 'author': 'Jesse S.

An inventory on the knowledge on the wild edible and medicinal insects in the study areas is presented here. Results showedthat these key informants profusely utilized wide range of biological resources in diverse ways, and thus contribute to their daily activities. As a whole, the factors that influenced their entomological practices include their socio-demographic and educational background, accessibility to urban societies and the open availability of certain resources particularly the insects they use and the influence brought about by their family and community. Moreover, these informants had different insects used in their practices, and they had their ways of preparing and administering these as medicines and food.

The present study designed to evaluate the antibacterial activities of Tubog,Ficus nota (Blanco) Merr fruit and leaves with ethanolic extracts. Preliminary phytochemical and histochemical studies were carried out. The antimicrobial activity of the fruit extract against pathogenic strains evaluated based on the zone of inhibition using paper disc diffusion method with tested bacteria of Escherichia coli ATTC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATTC 25923, Klebsiella pneumonia UPCC 1360, and Salmonella typhimurium UPCC 1368.The qualitative phytochemical tests exhibited the presence of common bioactive compounds including alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, saponins, flavonoids and anthraquinones. The aqueous extract has shown high activity in ethanolic extract has shown significantly good activity when compared to standard chemotherapeutic agent Chloramphenicol. Based on the result it was concluded that Ficus nota are rich in bioactive components and exhibits antimicrobial activity against pathogens. Cytotoxicity result showed higher toxicity with the fruit compared with ficus nota leaves ethanolic extract. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/107', 'author': 'Levitah C.

Then D is a (v, k, λ) - difference set if every nonzero element of the group can be expressed as a difference d1 - d2 of elements of D in exactly λ ways. Let q be a prime of the form q = nN + 1 for integers n>1 and N>1. For q<1000, this study shows the construction of difference sets in the additive group of the field GF(q) from unions of cyclotomic classes of order N = 14 using a computer search. The construction consisted of computer programs derived from the definitions and theorems on difference sets using Python. The results revealed that only the union of seven cyclotomic classes such as C0(14, q) U C2(14, q) U C4(14, q) U C6(14, q) U C8(14, q) U C10(14, q) U C12(14, q) forms a quadratic cyclotomic difference set. Similarly, this union together with zero forms a difference set equivalent to the modified quadratic cyclotomic difference sets. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1205', 'author': 'Benedict M.
