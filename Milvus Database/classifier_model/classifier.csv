documents_partition,text,The contrasting practices of private and public institutions affect individuals motivation to work on the maintenance of its facilities. This
documents_partition,text,paper attempts to develop a model that could predict how many years a facility (private or government) would last based
documents_partition,text,on the given number of assumptions and random data. The study used an experimental design using simulation modeling. Assumptions were
documents_partition,text,formulated to measure different variables. Findings revealed that government facilities tend to deteriorate faster compared to its private counterparts. Government
documents_partition,text,facilities would only last approximately up to six (6) years then reach its critical level. This is due to the
documents_partition,text,assumption that only 40% of government institutions are effective workers. Low percentage of effective workers would translate to less motivation
documents_partition,text,of the worker to pursue any transaction that could possibly help the current state of the facility. On the other
documents_partition,text,"hand, more than half of the Private facilities would last more than five years before reaching a critical level. This"
documents_partition,text,is due to the assumption that private workers are 20% higher compared to government workers in terms of percentage of
documents_partition,text,"effective workers. A highly motivated worker will always be willing to spend time, even extra time, to perform his job."
documents_partition,text,"Benign neglect of a less motivated workforce would result to non performance of his assigned task. Therefore, increasing the level"
documents_partition,text,of motivation of an employee is the primordial concern of every organization whether private or public because an increase of
documents_partition,text,well motivated and effective workforce would encourage everyone to help maintain and to extend the life of every facility. link:

documents_partition,text,"In the Philippines, the installation of solar panels on the rooftops of residential and commercial buildings has increased in popularity."
documents_partition,text,"Even if the country has high solar insolation, energy conversion is still inefficient since the solar panel arrays are not"
documents_partition,text,always facing in perpendicular to the sun. Technologies related to increasing the solar panel efficiency such as solar trackers are
documents_partition,text,usually complex and expensive. This problem is addressed by designing a low cost dual axis solar tracker with the integration
documents_partition,text,of specular reflector system. The dual axis tracker system can move the panel and the reflector assembly in a precise
documents_partition,text,"and controlled manner to ensure maximum output. This was achieved by using a LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) compass assembly, gear"
documents_partition,text,"system, and stepper motor mechanism. To measure the solar panel output, a voltage sensing circuit was incorporated instead of using"
documents_partition,text,the existing optical and time-based techniques. The system performance was tested in both the controlled and the actual environments. Experimental
documents_partition,text,"data have shown that when the panel is perpendicular to the light source, the system yields maximum energy. The need"
documents_partition,text,for a tracking and planar reflector system is notably important when the light source moves away from the normal because
documents_partition,text,this results to a significant drop of the panelâ€™s average efficiency. The addition of the tracker alone had greater enhancement
documents_partition,text,effect than with the specular reflector only. The tracker boosts the efficiency by 69.55% while the specular reflector boosts it
documents_partition,text,by only 15.12%. Combining the tracker and the specular reflector yields the best result with a 92.33% boost on the
documents_partition,text,average efficiency. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/210

documents_partition,text,The Philippines has been inundated with socio-politico issues that impede peopleâ€™s desire for the countryâ€™s uninterrupted progress. These issues may
documents_partition,text,be complex but their antidote is contrarily simple. An answer is found in Immanuel Kantâ€™s thought on moral culture which
documents_partition,text,"pertains to three essential features, namely: obedience, truthfulness, and sociableness. This qualitative research focuses on the fundamental ideas in the"
documents_partition,text,"section on moral culture in Kantâ€™s On Education. As my contribution to the fund of knowledge, I proceed by establishing"
documents_partition,text,the implications and antitheses of the three features of Kantâ€™s moral culture. A discussion on obedience differentiates its two kinds:
documents_partition,text,"absolute and voluntary. Absolute obedience is the result of compulsion by a command, while voluntary obedience is the result of"
documents_partition,text,confidence by a reasonable will. It is impossible to think of character formation without also thinking of truthfulness. Kant asserts
documents_partition,text,that a man who tells lies has no character. Sociableness emphasizes on the importance of building relationships and friendships. The
documents_partition,text,researcher contends that these three features of moral culture have corresponding antitheses: violation of laws of the land for obedience;
documents_partition,text,lying and dishonesty (highest form is corruption in politics) for truthfulness; and human rights violation (highest form is war) for
documents_partition,text,"sociableness. Finally, these features are imperative in forging peace and social order which usher to a kind of development that"

documents_partition,text,modelled scenarios based on the combination of interruptible load program and the time-of-use scheme. The scenarios were modelled using a
documents_partition,text,"Binary Particle Swarm Optimization and were simulated using Matlab v6. In all the scenarios, this model successfully optimizes the battery"
documents_partition,text,dispatch scheduling while simultaneously minimizes the DUâ€™s penalty from exceeding the maximum allowable power demand. This algorithm also optimizes the
documents_partition,text,"linearly forecasted demand for the next six year for all the scenarios. Then, an economic analysis for the possible investment"

documents_partition,text,"Particular challenges faced are related to technology and internet access. As graduate work is expected to be about research tasks,"
documents_partition,text,subscribing to paid resources is seen as an issue. It is also crucial to recognize how the experience has caused
documents_partition,text,"stress for students. The experienced challenges are resolved by augmenting studentsâ€™ technological capacity, realigning personal values and perspectives, and resorting"
documents_partition,text,to free and open access journals to sustain research activities. The COVID-19 experience has taught graduate students the importance of
documents_partition,text,"technology, the significance of revisiting oneâ€™s values, and the reflection on their quest to finish their graduate studies. Lastly, assistance"
documents_partition,text,"to graduate students can be done by proactively offering infrastructure assistance, socio-emotional support, and institutionalizing responsive and flexible communication mechanisms."
