SUBJECT		:	EXTERNAL LMS PROVIDER




After due deliberation made by the School Board members during their special meeting on July 2, 2020, we would like to inform you that we shall be using the services of an external provider for the Learning Management System (LMS) of the university effective the start of Academic Year 2020-2021.

The board decided that even if we are using an external provider, we shall still call it as “ADELATE LMS” powered by CAL-D2L’s BRIGHTSPACE.

We are confident that with your support and cooperation, we will be able to deliver what is expected of us by the students.

Thank you.  Adelante!
