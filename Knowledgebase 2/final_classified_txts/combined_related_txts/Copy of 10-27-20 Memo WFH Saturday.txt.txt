SUBJECT	:	No On-site Duty on Saturdays for Non-teaching Personnel 



During this pandemic, the Administration has decided that effective October 24, 2020, there shall be no more on-site duty for non-teaching personnel on Saturdays.  The required number of days for on-site schedule shall be evenly distributed on Monday to Friday as Saturdays shall be work from home (WFH).

The office/department heads are requested to immediately submit their personnel's updated schedule to the Human Resource Management Office (HRMO).  Should there be a need to report to the office/department on a Saturday in case of exigencies, an approval shall be sought from the proper authorities following the existing policies and procedures in this regard.

For your guidance and compliance.  Thank you!
