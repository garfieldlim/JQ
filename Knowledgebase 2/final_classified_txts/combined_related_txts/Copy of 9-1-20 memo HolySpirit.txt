We enjoin all administrators, faculty members, staff and students to attend our ONLINE MASS in honor of the Holy Spirit.  Be counted and be part of this celebration!  

Please take note that after the homily, the faculty members will have their profession of faith and oath, a commitment to adhere to the Catholic Faith and its ideals and to teach the Catholic doctrines to our students.  

We look forward to your participation as we journey together for the achievement of the Universityâ€™s Vision, Mission and Goals in spite of the pandemic we are presently challenged.  

Let us pray for the healing of all!  Adelante!
