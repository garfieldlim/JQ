Greetings!

This is in connection with the use of an external provider for the University’s Learning Management System (powered by CAL-D2L’s Brightspace) for Academic Year 2020-2021.  Please be advised that a training needs analysis survey shall be conducted as first step of the training program for the new LMS.
