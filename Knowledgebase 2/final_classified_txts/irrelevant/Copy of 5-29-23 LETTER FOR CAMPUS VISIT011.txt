Dear Fr. Decena:
Good day!

The BSIT students of Eastern Visayas State University - Ormoc Campus will
be having an Educational Tour in Cebu this May 30-June 1, 2023.

USJ-R School of Computer Studies, being one of the top ICT schools in the
region, a CHED Center of Excellence for IT Education, with PAASCU accredited
programs, and with several honors and accolades brought by its students and faculty
members, is one of the IT tour destinations of schools from other islands and provinces,
offering ICT programs.

EVSU - Ormoc Campus has requested to visit USJ-R SCS this June 1, 2023, at
9:00 AM in the Basak Campus. In this connection, we would like to request your
permission that we allow the students and faculty of EVSU-Ormoc to conduct the
visit.

As a CHED Center of Excellence in IT Education, it is also our responsibility to
help other institutions and to inspire students to pursue their aspirations and do better in
their chosen field, thereby improving the ICT human resource in the region.

Attached is the letter request of EVSU-Ormoc.

Your approval of this request is very much appreciated.

Thank you and Adelante!

Respectfully yours,
