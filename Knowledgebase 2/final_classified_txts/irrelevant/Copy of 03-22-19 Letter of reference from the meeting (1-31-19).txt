QA Director
USJ-R Cebu City

Dear Dr. Catipay,

iach A lng |,
This is in reference to a meeting last January 31, called and facilitated by your office.

As discussed, below are the action items that we are to execute, along with its respective
timeline:

e Mr. Jesse Susada of CPRDS will create/ identify the different columns/ fields that
will serve as our basis for the researches/ journals worked out by the identified
faculty, timeline will be March, 2019.

e The following faculty members will be provided de-loading in undertaking the web
application development this Summer 2019:

o Mrs. Marisa Buctuanon, a faculty of CICCT will take charge in developing
the module that will be integrated with the present Web app for Admin/
Faculty Evaluation. Reason for this strategy is, it’s easier to integrate into
the existing app, considering that authority rule structure is already in place
and is “user empowered driven” already, which works well best in attaining
content creation.

Timeline for this will be:
« Early April for the integration of the columns/ fields identified by
Mr. Susada and the creation of Database Schema
« April and early May will be the web applications development
« Mid May will be the testing/ deployment and walkthrough of the
identified users

o Mr. Roderick Bandalan, a faculty of CICCT will take charge in the
development of the “seminars attended by the faculty” module and will be
assisted by EDP in extracting the existing data of the data contained in the
old HRIS module that is not web based.

In moving forward Dr. Choll, please do advise what will be our next move, as we
are already preparing loads for this summer. Thank you.
