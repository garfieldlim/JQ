b) Health Information Systems: Expand the curriculum to include in-depth coverage of electronic health
records (EHRs), computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems, and clinical decision support
systems (CDSS). This module should focus on EHR documentation, data entry standards, interoperability,
and data analysis.

c) Telehealth and Telemedicine: Introduce students to telehealth and telemedicine technologies, including
virtual care platforms, remote monitoring devices, and mobile health applications. Provide hands-on
experience through simulated telehealth consultations and discuss the advantages, challenges, and ethical
implications of remote healthcare delivery.

d) Data Analytics and Informatics: Incorporate a module that emphasizes data management, analytics, and
visualization techniques in nursing practice. Students should learn how to collect and interpret data, identity
