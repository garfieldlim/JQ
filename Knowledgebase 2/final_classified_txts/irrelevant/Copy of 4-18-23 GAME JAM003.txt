48-hour game creation challenge that is slated on April 15-16, 2023, at BRD 1 and 2, (Sunctouy £ Saturdle
USJ-R Basak Campus. 3

A game jam is an excellent opportunity for entertainment and multimedia
computing students, as well as multimedia applications development students
specializing in game development, to showcase their skills, creativity, and teamwork. The
theme "Beyond the Horizon" offers a unique challenge that can inspire participants to
think outside the hox and create innovative and exciting games,

By participating in a game jam, students can gain valuable experience in game
development, including game design, programming, sound design, and graphic design.
They can also learn to work collaboratively, brainstorm ideas, and implement feedback
from their peers and mentors. Game jams also offer an opportunity to network with
industry professionals, who may be judging the games or offering feedback on them.

In this regard, we would like to ask your permission that SCS be allowed te
conduct the said event and that students who are participating in the Game Jam tc
be allowed to stay inside the campus during day time and overnight as follows:
