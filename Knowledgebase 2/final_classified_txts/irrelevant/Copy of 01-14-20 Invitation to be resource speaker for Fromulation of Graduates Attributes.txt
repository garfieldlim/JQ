Dear Fr. Maspar:
Greetings!

The Cebu Technological University (CTU) will be conducting a conference entitled, “Formulation of
Graduates Attributes”. Identifying these specific attributes will form as baseline indicators for standardizing
the graduates’ qualities of the university which will be the guide in the formulation and implementation of the
curriculum through mapping and course syllabus making. The Curricular Programs that will be the subject in
the formulation of graduate attributes are the following: Engineering, Technology, Arts and Sciences, and
Management.

In this regard, may we invite Dr. Dennis KilongKilong and Dr. Gregg Victor Gabison to be the
Resource Speakers/Facilitators for the Engineering and Technology respectively in the 2-day conference
which is scheduled on January 16-17, 2020 (Thursday & Friday) at the CTU-Main Campus, E-mixed
Bidg., from 8:00 am to 5:00 in the afternoon.

We believe that these two (2) distinguish faculty members of your prestigious institution will be able to
come up with a framework for graduate attributes that will guide our faculty members in producing quality
graduates of the university imbued with abilities, generic skills, technical skills and work readiness that will be
developed during the course of their time with CTU.

Thank you very much and more power!

Sincerely yours,

j yr
