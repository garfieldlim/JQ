Please be informed that the Department of Accountancy and
Finance of the College of Commerce, in coordination the Junior
Philippine Institute of Accountants, will be having its 2.4 Academic
Congress on February 7, 2019 (Thursday) and February 8, 2019 (Friday)
from 8:00 am to 5:00 p.m. at the Center for Performing Arts. This is our way
of exposing our students to the accountancy profession from the
viewpoint of prominent alumni and industry partners. In addition, this
activity will also serve to showcase our esteemed University ond students
to invited Senior High School students from the city and province of Cebu.

In connection with this, we would like to request that all 2nd year, 34
year, and 4'" year Accountancy and Management Accounting students
who will join the said event be excused from their respective classes on
the days of the Academic Congress. Furthermore, we would also request

that they be given special exams or alternative assignments for any
activity that they will be missing.

Your favorable consideration to this request is highly appreciated.
Thank you very much.
