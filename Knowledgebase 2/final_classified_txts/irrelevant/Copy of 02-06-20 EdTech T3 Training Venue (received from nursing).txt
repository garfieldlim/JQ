SUBJECT: EDTECH T3 TRAINING VENUE

Dear Dr. Verano:

The University will be having the EdTech T3 (Train the Trainors/Champions
Training) this February 6-8, 2020 at Room SJ 310, USJ-R Main Campus.

In the conduct of the above training, some classes will be affected and
displaced. With this, we would like to request your department to identify alternative
venues or activities for the affected classes listed below:

NCM 110 (Lab) | Nursing Informatics | MWF | 1:00-3:00PM | SJ 310

We hope to have a smooth implementation of the institutional EdTech Training and
at the same time have the least number of affected classes.

Thank you and Adelante!
