a seminar-workshop series that contributes to the professional development of Josenian
Educators. The series would highlight the topics on the photo and video editing, public
speaking, lesson planning, and acing the board exam.

in fine with this, we would like to invite one of your faculty members, Mr. Lee Roy Gadiane to
be our resource speaker for our first session entitled, Clever Tools to Simplify your
Presentations. The said session will be on February 18, 2023, at 1:00 - 4:00 PM. Also, we
would like to ask permission in your good office to utilize the CPs Jabs specifically the
