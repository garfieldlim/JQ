| would like to request from your office a change in the schedule of one of the subject
offerings in the department. The reason behind this change is due to the faculty's time
availability and the subject requires specific hardware and software installation which 's
missing in the previous room assignment. The students enrolled in this class agreed to
have it in this schedule. Below is the information of the affected subject cnd the

suggested new schedule.
