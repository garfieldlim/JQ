Higher Education Development Fund Staff (HEDFS)
Commission on Higher Education

Dear Dr. Gunigundo:

Greetings!

This has reference to the check of Php 2,100,000.00 issued in favor of USJ-R for the approved
proposal entitled “C3 Project (Create, Collaborate and Commercialize)” under the
Information Technology Education Center of Excellence Project of the CHED.

We are issuing a provisional/temporary receipt that will be brought by Dr. Gregg Victor D.
Gabison when he claims the said check. As a matter of policy, the Official Receipt will be
issued by the Accounting Office once the fund has been turned over to them. Be assured that
we will be sending you the O.R. immediately.

We are confident you will understand our position on the matter. Thank you and more

power!

Truly yours,

REV. FR. HER C. MASPARA, OAR
President
