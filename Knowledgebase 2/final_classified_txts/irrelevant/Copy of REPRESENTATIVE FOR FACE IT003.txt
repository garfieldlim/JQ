Dear Ms Netbha Iglesia,
Good Day!

| am Lieudwig A. Abella, the group representative for Face It from the School of Computer Studies of the
University of San Jose-Recoletos. Our capstone project Face It, is a desktop application that aims to aid
Psychotherapists/guidance counselors as a mitigating tool to help their clients overcome social anxiety as part of
exposure therapy. This is through the means of controlled simulated scenarios thatthe user will have to undergo.
With the help of facial recognition, the current emotional state of the user will be captured and will be used to
adjust the simulated environment accordingly. The data collected would only be facial feature scores and the
results from a standardized pretest and posttest for assessing social anxiety disorder. Participants will remain
â€˜anonymous while using the application as the application does not require the user to provide any personal or
sensitive information,

{mn line with this, we are hoping for guidance and assistance from your good office in recommending participants
forthe usability testing of our capstone project that will be conducted during the first semester of AY 2022-2023
We would like to request to place a computer unit withthe game installed in the SPDC office at Basak Campus
toallow full anonymity ofthe users, even tothe developers.

We can be contacted through the email, icudwig.abella.20@usjr.edu.ph or 09151634190, We look forward to
collaborating with your office to promote and improve the well-being of the USI-R students, especially in this
time of pandemic

Sincerely, Noted By,
