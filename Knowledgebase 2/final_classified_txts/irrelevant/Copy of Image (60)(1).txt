Dear Dr. Tacmo:

The fourth year students of the College of ICCT has scheduled a two-day IT
company visit on March 1 and 8, 2019 as part of the requirements of the subject
SEMTOUR â€” Seminars and Tours class. The purpose of the activity is to expose
students to local IT companies thereby providing them a good picture of the actual
working environment and a good judgment in selecting which company to work for after
graduation.

In line with the requirements of CHED, we would like to request your office for the
conduct of medical examination and release of medical certificate for the students of the
said class.

Your approval is very much appreciated.

Thank you.
Sincere S,
Wy
