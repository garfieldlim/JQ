Dear Fr. Coliz:

The School of Computer Studies of the University of San Jose-Recoletos
is this year’s host of the Summer International Project-Based Learning (iPBL),
‘which will be participated by our partner universities Southern Taiwan University of
Science and Technology (STUST) and Osaka Institute of Technology (OIT).

‘The IPBL program is scheduled this August 21-25, 2023, at USJ-R- Basak
Campus. This year's theme centers around smart farming, which directly
Contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 1 (No Poverty) and SDG
2 (Zoro Hunger). As part of this program, students from all three universities will
collaboratively design and implement a prototype for a smart hydroponics system. The
teams will work together to tackle the project that encompasses various components
of electrical, electronics, and computing.

In this regard, we would lke to request your final approval that SCS be allowed
tohost the iPBL 2023 as scheduled.

Your approval and favorable attention afforded to this endeavor are very much
appreciated.

Thank you very much, Adelante!

Yours very t
