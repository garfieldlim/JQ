Dear Rev. Fr. Sia:

Good day! We would like to request from your good office the creation of ee.usjr.edu.ph
domain, hosting and dedicated server. This is primarily intended for the department of
electrical engineering’s plan to reach out to more prospective students as well as to all USJ-R
alumni. In addition, this will contain our projects and activities, announcements and updates.

In order to secure and update the said web, Mr. KEITH VINCENT RANOA, a 2nd year computer
engineering student, volunteered to be the web developer of this project under the supervision

of Engr. Piedad.

We look forward to your kind consideration of this request. Thank you.
