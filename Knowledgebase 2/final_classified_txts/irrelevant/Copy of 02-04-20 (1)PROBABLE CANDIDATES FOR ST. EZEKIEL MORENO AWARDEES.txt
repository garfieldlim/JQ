Subject: Probable Candidates for St. Ezekiel Moreno Awardees

Greetings from the CRE!

The University’s Search for the Saint Ezekiel Moreno Awardee (SEMA) is on! And
the deserving awardees may just be one among the graduating students from your
department this Second Semester S.Y. 2020. Help us find this Josenian who in his/ her
own ways, has tried to live up to the ideals and values which the University stands for.
Help us discover this student(s) whom we can proudly honor, during the graduation
rites, this April 04, 2020, for leading a life of faithfulness to the Lord and generous
service to the community as St. Ezekiel did.

You only have to do the following:

—

. Identify from attached list those who will be graduating this semester.

2. Instruct these identified students to report to the CRE for a preliminary interview,
on the schedules attached herewith, and;

3. Return the list to the CRE (with the names of graduating students properly

marked and with their contact numbers), on or before March 03, 2020

(Tuesday).

By doing the above simple things, you will certainly be doing something great for
your students, your department and our University.

Thank you very much. We hope to hear from you soon. God bless!

Sincerely,

Dr. Jo}it M. Foronda
Chairperson, CRE
