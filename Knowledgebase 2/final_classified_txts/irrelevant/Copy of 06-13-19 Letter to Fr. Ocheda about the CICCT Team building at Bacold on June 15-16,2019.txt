Dear Fr. Ocheda:
Good day!

This has reference to the scheduled Team Building of our College Faculty Members and
IT Technical Staff on June 15-16, 2019 in Bacolod City.

The event will include the following:

June 15 (Day 1): Benchmarking at UNO-R
Bacolod City Tour

June 16 (Day 2): The Ruins of Bacolod City
Fun at Campuestohan Highland Resort

In this regard, we would like to request for your approval on our school bus reservation
on the said dates. We do hope that you will approve of this request, as it will be logistically
challenging and expensive if we have to hire third party transportation service with respect to
our expected Itinerary.

Thank you Fr. Ocheda, God Speed and Adelante!

Respectfully 2. as.

DR. ieee VICTOR D. Sen
