Dear Fr. Celiz: mecenco sy: SHAT CAR

This Second Semester, SY 2022-2023, the School of Computer Studies would like to
respectfully endorse MR. ERIC V. MAGTO to be rehired as a Full-time Faculty member of the
CS/IT department.

With the increase in SCS student enrollment and considering that some faculty members
retired in the previous school years and or resigned from their teaching position, a good number
of teaching assignments were left without a full-time faculty to handle.

With him back in the department, he will be able to help in the courses for Computer
Science, Web Applications Development, and Information Systems.

Attached is the summary of performance evaluation results in the First Semester, SY
2019-2020 to support our recommendation.

We look forward to your final approval. Thank you.
