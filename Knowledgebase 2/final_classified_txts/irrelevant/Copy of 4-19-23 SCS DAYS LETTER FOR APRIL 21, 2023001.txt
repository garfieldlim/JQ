Dear Fr. Decena:

This letter is in relation to the impending declaration of a holiday on April 21,
2023 for the Eid al Fitr religious celebration of our Muslim brothers and sisters.

The School of Computer Studies has already finalized the schedule of the SCS
Days 2023 celebration, having April 21, 2023 (Friday) as the last day and the
culmination of the school days. The events for April 21 could no longer be rescheduled
as the venue is no longer available in the following days and weeks.

Should there be a holiday, conducting our culminating activities on April 21 will be
favorable to our students as they won’t miss any classes and they don’t have to worry
with other matters.

With this in mind, we would like to ask your approval that we be allowed to
conduct the SCS Days Culminating Activities on April 21, 2023 in the Basak
Campus.

We hope that this request merits your support and approval.

Thank you very much. Adelante!
Sincerely yours,

DR. JOV C. CUIZON
Dean, School of Computer Studies
