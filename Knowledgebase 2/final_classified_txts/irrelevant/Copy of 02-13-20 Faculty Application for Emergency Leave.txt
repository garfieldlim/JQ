Subject: FACULTY APPLICATION FOR EMERGENCY LEAVE

Dear Fr. Maspara,

This is in connection with the request letter sent by one of our faculty members,
ENGR. VICENTE Ill F. PATALITA, who recently lost his fiancée due to multiple organ
failure secondary to a cancer ailment.

Two years ago, the couple got engaged and was about to get married. However,
early last year, his fiancée’s mother lost to a battle with cancer while the father had a mild
stroke. It was also in the middle of last year that his fiancée got diagnosed with stage 4
cancer, same ailment as with the mother.

| am personally writing this letter, to ask your approval for Vic’s request for an
emergency leave. He is a fine and respectful person and; a functional and reliable faculty
member of our college. He was also critical in being the coach of several of our teams
winning in national competitions, including the current two (2) teams who are already in
this year’s top 20 National Smart Sweep competition. | hope we could grant his request
so that he can spend the last days with his fiancée before burial.

Thank you very much Fr. Cricks. Adelante!

Respectfully yours,

La~ Sa
