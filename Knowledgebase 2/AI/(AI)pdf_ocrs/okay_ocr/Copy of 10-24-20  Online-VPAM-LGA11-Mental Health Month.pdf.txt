To All Concerned
Subject: Mental Health Month

USI-R declares an academic break on October 26, 2020, Monday in observance of Mental Health Awareness Month.

In connection to this, online classes will be suspended for a day. There will be no classes in the Basic Education Level. College and Graduate School students may consider it as a study day in preparation for the Midterm examinations during the week.

Furthermore, everyone is encouraged to engage in healthy relaxation to keep the body and mind fit and strong. Those who wish to seek free professional help on mental health concerns may reach out to our counselors, psychiatrists, and partner doctors.

Josenians, let us continue to care, provide support, and strength for each other.

In caritas et scientia,

Rev. Fr. Leo Alaras, OAR
VP-Academics
