The commencement exercises and other graduation-related activities (e.g. Graduation Ball/Ringhop/Recognition Ceremony) are postponed until further notice. Their specific dates (including the start of summer classes) shall be finalized once we get official clearance that it's already safe to hold mass gatherings.

Furthermore, please be informed that the school is waiving the requirement for online evaluation of teachers this second semester; as part of our precautionary measures, we could not yet allow massive entry of students who have missed to do the online evaluation.

Everyone is directed to be cautious and to take preventive measures on the alarming respiratory outbreak. Keep yourself updated through our official FB page for further announcements.
