MEMORANDUM
TO: All School Presidents/Directors
cc: House Priors

SUBJECT: EDUCAR International Conference

Dear Brothers,

Greetings in the Lord!

Based on the recent survey conducted by the Secretariat of Educational Apostolate in Rome, majority of the respondents (school heads) prefer that the EDUCAR International Conference for deans, directors, teachers, and academic personnel be done through online conference, where these from our schools in Colombia, Costa Rica, and Spain, who can speak English, can share their experiences with the Recoletos schools in the Philippines.

Venezuela is also considering attending this online event.

In view of this, would you please provide me with a list of your deans, directors, teachers, and academic personnel, who are willing to attend this online learning which will be scheduled at 8:30/9:00 PM (Philippine time) to accommodate different time zones.

Please submit the list of participants to this email info@uno-plus.edu or not later than June 19, 2020.

Thank you very much for your active involvement!

Augustinian Recollects. God bless us all in all our endeavors.

The educational apostolate of the Order of
