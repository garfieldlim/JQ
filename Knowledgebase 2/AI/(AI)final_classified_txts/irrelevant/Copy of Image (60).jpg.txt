Dear Dr. Tacmo:

The fourth year students of the College of Computing and Information Sciences have scheduled a two-day company visit on March 1 and 8, 2019 as part of the requirements of the subject SEMTOUR-Seminars and Tours class. The purpose of the activity is to expose students to local IT companies thereby providing them a good picture of the actual working environment and a good judgment in selecting which company to work for after graduation.

In line with the requirements of CHED, we would like to request your office for the conduct of medical examination and release of medical certificate for the students of the said class.

Your approval is very much appreciated.

Thank you.
Sincerely yours,
VAL
