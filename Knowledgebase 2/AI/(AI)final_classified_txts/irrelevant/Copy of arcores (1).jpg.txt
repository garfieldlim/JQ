To all Religious of the Province of St. Ezekiel Moreno
Attention: Local CSEC-R Anchors

Dear Brothers:
Greetings of peace and joy!

Responding to the call of the Church to be present in the peripheries, and to be creators of communion who are committed to a change of lifestyle (institutional, communitarian, and personal), the religious of the Province of St. Ezekiel Moreno assume "a committed conscience...to take on a preferential option for the poor, for the family, and for life, [and for the environment] making decisions concerning appropriate responses in evangelization and in pastoral work from a shared process of discernment" (cf. Rule 5.2; Constitution, 282).

This commitment will be made manifest in the coming ARCORES HEART SOLIDARITY CAMPAIGN 2019-2020 on February 5-6, 2020, at the University of San Jose-Rec
