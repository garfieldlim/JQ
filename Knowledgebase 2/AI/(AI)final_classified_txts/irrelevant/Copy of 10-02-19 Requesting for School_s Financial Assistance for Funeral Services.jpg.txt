Dear Fr. Maspara:

We would like to inform your office that the father of Engr. Gene P. Abello (CICCT Faculty), Paquito S. Abello., died last September 29, 2019. The mortal remains of Mr. Abello lie at the Lourdes Parish Mortuary at Punta Princesa, Cebu City.

In relation to this matter, we would like to request that the bereaved family of Mr. Abello be given our school’s financial assistance to help his family with the expenses for funeral services.

Your approval to this request is highly appreciated.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely yours,

Dr. Gregg Victor D. Gabison
