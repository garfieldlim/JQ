- Capitalize proper nouns such as "University of San Jose-Recoletos" and "CS Thesis Writing".
- Correct the formatting of the table to ensure consistency and readability.
- Remove unnecessary punctuation marks and symbols, such as colons and asterisks.
- Use clear and concise language for course titles and descriptions.
