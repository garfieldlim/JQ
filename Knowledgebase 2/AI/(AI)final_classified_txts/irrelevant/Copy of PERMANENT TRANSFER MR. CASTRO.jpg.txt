Subject: Permanent Transfer of Mr. Benedict M. Castro from Senior High School to the School of Computer Studies Effective First Semester, SY 2022-2023

Dear Dr. Tapana,

The School of Computer Studies (SCS) would like to request your endorsement for the permanent transfer of Mr. Benedict M. Castro from the Senior High School Department to the School of Computer Studies effective this First Semester, SY 2022-2023.

Mr. Castro started as a Full-time Probationary Faculty at the Senior High School Department in February of 2018. He was temporarily transferred to the School of Computer Studies during the First Semester of SY 2021-2022. We believe that his transfer will benefit both the SHS and SCS Departments as he can share his expertise and experience with the computer studies faculty and students.

Furthermore, we request that the counting of his probationary status be continued as he transferred to the School of Computer Studies.

We seek your approval and endorsement for this request. Thank you very much. Adelante!

Sincerely,
