Dear Fr. Maspara:
Greetings!

I am John Leeroy A. Gadiane, a faculty from the School of Computer Studies and currently pursuing the Master of Science in Computer Science at the Cebu Institute of Technology - University. I am a grantee of the CHED Scholarships for Graduate Studies (SGS) starting June 2017 and was expected to complete the program last 2020. As part of the program's requirement, to have my thesis presented at a technical conference in computing, I recently presented my research paper virtually at the 1st GCCRC (Global Convergence Content Research Center) International Conference last May 7, 2021 at Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea. This conference was recommended by my adviser and dean of the graduate school, Dr. Cherry Sta. Romana of CIT-U.

In this regard and complying with the scholarship requirement, I am writing this letter to inform you of my intent and seek your approval to shift from Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) to Master of Computer Science (MCS). The need to shift is a recommendation of Dr. Sta Romana to complete my graduate program degree.

Thank you, father, for the favorable response to this request.

Adelante!

Best regards,

John Leeroy A. Gadiane
Faculty, School of Computer Studies
