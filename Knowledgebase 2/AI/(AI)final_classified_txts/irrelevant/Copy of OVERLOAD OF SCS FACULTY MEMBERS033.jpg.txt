Dear Fr Alaras:

Due to the difficulty in finding replacements for faculty members who recently resigned/retired, some subject offerings are left unassigned. In this regard, I would like to request that these extra loads be given to the SCS Faculty members as Substitution Teaching Loads. The following are the faculty members with their requested teaching overload:

ABELLO, GENE P 26.0 24.0 Excess 2 hours is due to Prog1 which is a 3-unit course with 5 contact hours.
CASTRO, BENEDICT 24.0
CUIZON, JOVELYN eee Gael Deloading of 9 units for Adelante LMS
GADIANE, JOHN LEEROY 26.0 24.0 2.0; Excess 2 hours is due to DataStruct which is a 3-unit course with 5 contact hours.
PATALITA, VICENTE Hl 25.0 24.0 0 Excess 1 hour is due to loads of a 3-unit course with 5 contact hours.
With your approval on this request, it will be of great help to our school operation. Thank you very much.

Yours truly,
DR. JOV . CUIZON
Dean, SCS
