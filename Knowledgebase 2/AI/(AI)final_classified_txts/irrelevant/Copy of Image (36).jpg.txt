Dear Father Ocheda,

Greetings!

The computer laboratories in our college is scheduled to replace computer units after three years. This summer, thirty-five units in SA-312 laboratory have been replaced with new ones. Consequently, we will be turning over the same number of units to the Property Administration Office. However, may I request that our college be able to use sixteen (16) units for the following purposes?

No. of units Purpose
5 Platform Technology Class (Main Campus)
5 Platform Technology Class (Basak Campus)
5 Reserved (back up units for main laboratories)
1 Data Center - Main Campus (for testing purposes)

Platform Technology or PT is one of the subjects offered during the first semester and this subject entails hardware and software. At present, we lack computer units to be used for the hardware part.

Five units are planned to be used for backup purposes for the three main computer laboratories in the main campus.

A unit will be used for testing purposes in our data center.

Thank you very much for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
