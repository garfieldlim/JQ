The Regional Inclusive Innovation Center (RIIC) is a project funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through its Strengthening Trade and Reform's Economic Competitiveness (STRIDE) program. The aim of the RIIC is to create an ecosystem that supports innovation and collaboration among various stakeholders in the region, including government, industry, academe, and civil society.

The meeting on September 12, 2019, at the Lemon Caf√©, Gold Prince Hotel and Suites, Acacia St, Cebu City, will provide an opportunity for stakeholders to engage in a discourse on the assessment and development of the Cebu RIIC plan. The event will be attended by representatives from DTI-Cebu, USJR, and other relevant institutions in the region.

The University of San Jose-Recoletos (USJR) has been invited to participate in the meeting as a key stakeholder in the Cebu RIIC initiative. The university's expertise and insights will be valuable in developing and perfecting the plan, which aims to bridge gaps between government, industry, and academe, and create a regional ecosystem that fosters innovation and collaboration.

The draft program for the meeting is attached to this invitation. If you have any questions or clarifications, please do not hesitate to contact Mr. Joenero Bollozos at (032) 255-7082/253-2631 loc. 109 or email us at r07Cebu-IDD@dti.gov.ph.

We look forward to your participation and contributions towards the success of the Cebu RIIC plan. Thank you.
