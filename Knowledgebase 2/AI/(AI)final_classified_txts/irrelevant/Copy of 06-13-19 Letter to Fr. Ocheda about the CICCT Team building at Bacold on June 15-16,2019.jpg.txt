Dear Dean Sen:
Good day!

Reference to your letter dated May 24, 2019 regarding the scheduled Team Building of
your College Faculty Members and IT Technical Staff on June 15-16, 2019 in Bacolod City. I
have approved your request for school bus reservation on the said dates. I understand that
it will be logistically challenging and expensive if you have to hire third party transportation
service with respect to your expected itinerary.

Please coordinate with the Property Office for the necessary arrangements. I hope that
you have a successful team building activity and that everyone in your college will benefit
from this event.

God's blessings upon you and your team!

Yours sincerely,

Rev. Fr. Arian Josef M. Ocheda, OAR
Property Administrator
