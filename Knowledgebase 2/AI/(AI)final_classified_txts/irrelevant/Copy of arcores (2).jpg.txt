Please find attached the program for the conference on "Social and Ecological Concerns: A Call to Solidarity" organized by the Commission on Social and Ecological Concerns - Recoletos. The conference will take place at the University of San Jose-Recoletos on January 30-31, 2020.

The conference fee does not cover accommodation. OAR priests will be accommodated in the USJR main convent, while women religious may opt to stay with their community in the area. Lay participants may choose from a list of hotels attached in this email. These hotels are recommended due to their proximity to the conference venue.

Participants are to pre-register on or before January 25, 2020. Registration can be done through email: research@usjr.edu.ph or by contacting Ms. Ingrid Ramos of USJR-CPRDS (2537900 loc. 244 or 09255006603). Upon pre-registration, the following information are needed:
