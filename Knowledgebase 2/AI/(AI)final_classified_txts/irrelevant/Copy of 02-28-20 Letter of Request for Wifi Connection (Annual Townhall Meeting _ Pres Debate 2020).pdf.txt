Re: Request for Wi-Fi Connection

Good Day!

In light of the upcoming SSC elections, The Purveyor Publication, in cooperation with Journalism Axis, will be having their annual Townhall Meeting and the newly established Presidential Debate. We would like to request from your good office to allow us to have our own Wi-Fi connection solely for the event.

This will be held on March 3,2020 (Tuesday) from 8:00 am ~ 12:30 pm at S Bldg, Mala Lobby. At the same time, it will also be broadcasted live on social medias and permitted on school TVs. Your help will be very much valued as Josenian studentry will once again cast their votes to choose the new leaders of the Supreme Student Council 39th congress.

Thank you so much and God bless your office,

Marie Mada
