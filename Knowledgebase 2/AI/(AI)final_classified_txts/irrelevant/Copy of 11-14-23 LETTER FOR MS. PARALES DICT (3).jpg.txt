Dear Rev. Fr. Alipin:

Good day!

We are pleased to inform you that one of our students, Ms. Alexis J. Parales, a third-year BSIT student, represented USJ-R at the DICT Hack4Gov Finals as a member of the wildcard team "Captcha" on October 16, 2023, in Manila. Based on the individual scoring results, Ms. Parales emerged as one of the overall Performance Excellence Awardees in the entire competition. This achievement afforded her the opportunity, along with other exceptional students, to represent the Philippines on the international stage.

In light of this, Ms. Parales was invited to be part of the team that will carry the country's flag in the 1%* ASEAN Cybershield (ACS) Hacking Contest (ACS CON) scheduled for November 21-24, 2023, in Jakarta, Indonesia.

Therefore, we are requesting your approval for Ms. Parales to participate in this international competition and for the university to extend its full support as she brings pride to the university and to the country. Your approval of this request is highly appreciated.

Thank you very much, Adelante!

Sincerely yours,

DR. JO CUIZON
Dean, SCS
