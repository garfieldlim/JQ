Dear Chairman Cuizon:

On behalf of Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology (STUST), I am pleased to extend a warm invitation for your colleagues and students to participate in this year's international Project Based Learning program at STUST. The program, which started in 2017 in collaboration with Osaka Institute of Technology (OIT), Japan, is focused on Robotics, allowing students from both universities to work together to achieve a common goal. This year marks the third year of the program, and we are excited to have faculty and students from the University of San Jose Recoletos (USJR) join as the third university and third country for this program. The 2019 i-PBL between STUST, OIT, and USJR will be an exciting event as it brings together students from various fields and nationalities to work on a common challenge. We would like to invite the USJR delegation from August 8 to August 17, 2019. Your tentative itinerary is shown in Appendix 1. Students will be housed in university dormitories with Taiwanese and Japanese students in a four-person room. The 2019 i-PBL program is subsidized by the Ministry of Education Office of Higher Education Sprout Project and STUST. The program will cover accommodation, project materials, and airport transfer from Kaohsiung International Airport to STUST.

We would like to invite the following faculty members and students from USJR to join us in this year's event:

Faculty Members:

1. Engr. Carmel Tejana, MSManE, MSIT
2. Mr. Ahdzleebee Formentera
3. Engr. Eduardo Piedad Jr., MSEE
