Dear College,

I would like to request permission for the excuse of 2nd and 3rd year CIC students for the following dates:

[Date]
[Time]

The Philippine Society of IT Educators (PSITE) Region 7 chapter of San Carlos will host the 2019 PSITE 7 Cebu ICT Student Congress on [Date], [Time] to 5:00 PM at the Michael Richartz Building, University of San Carlos - Talamban Campus, Cebu City.

This annual event brings together ICT students from the city and province of Cebu. This year's congress aims to equip students with the knowledge on the latest technologies and skills needed by IT graduates to meet the growing industry requirements.

For control purposes, PSITE 7 will be issuing certificates to confirm student's participation. Furthermore, we would also request that they be given special exams or alternative assignments for any activity that they will be missing.

Your favorable consideration to this request will be highly appreciated.

Thank you.
