Dear Fr. Celiz:

The School of Computer Studies of the University of San Jose-Recoletos is this year’s host of the Summer International Project-Based Learning (iPBL) program which will be participated by our partner universities Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology (STUST) and Osaka Institute of Technology (OIT).

The IPBL program is scheduled this August 21-25, 2023, at USJ-R Basak Campus. This year’s theme centers around smart farming, which directly contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 2 (Zero Hunger). As part of this program, students from all three universities will collaboratively design and implement a prototype for a smart hydroponics system. The teams will work together to tackle the project that encompasses various components of electrical, electronics, and computing.

In this regard, we would like to request your final approval that SCS be allowed to host the iPBL 2023 as scheduled.

Your approval and favorable attention afforded to this endeavor are very much appreciated.

Thank you very much, Adelante!

Yours very truly,

DR. JON “CUIZON
Dean, SCS
