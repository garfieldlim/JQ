SUBJECT: PERMISSION FOR EXCUSE OF COMMERCE STUDENTS

Please be informed that our US Work and Travel (WAT) 2020 and Internship Programs are well under way and we are already coordinating with our partner agency, First Place Inc (FPI), on all the necessary preparations. There will be an orientation for students and parents on July 6, 2019, 1:30 p.m. at the Center for Performing Arts. During the orientation, FPI will discuss in detail the objectives, procedures, timetable and related fees of the program.

In line with the department's efforts to reach out to a large number of students who may be interested to pursue international internship as well as work and travel opportunities, we would like to request that 3rd year and 2nd semester Commerce students joining the orientation be excused from their respective classes on July 5, 2019 from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.

Your favorable consideration to this request will be highly appreciated. Thank you very much.

Dean, College of Commerce
