The students’ response in the previous semester’s survey shows that they want to have more practice
sessions. This is where we can utilize and maximize the use of our state of the art facilities to provide them
with simulation laboratory sessions.

In our next academic year, we will be offering a new set of courses for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing
students that are specifically designed to cater their needs.

With all these changes happening and being implemented in USJ-R College of Nursing, we can assure you
that we are on our way to become one of the top nursing schools in the country.
