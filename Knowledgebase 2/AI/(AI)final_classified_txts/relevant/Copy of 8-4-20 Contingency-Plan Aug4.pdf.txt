GUIDELINES FOR THE PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF CORONA VIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19)
IN CONSTRUCTION SITES
PREPARED BY: PHILIPPINE CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION, INC. DATED APRIL 25, 2020

Introduction
The Philippines Construction Industry is currently experiencing an economic downturn as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, construction work must continue for several reasons including: to provide
employment opportunities; to prevent further losses; and to mitigate potential social unrest. This document sets
forth practical guidelines that contractors may follow in their respective job sites to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
These guidelines are not exhaustive but shall serve as a starting point for all contractors. The Philippine
Contractors Association, Inc. (PCA) strongly advises its members and the construction industry at large to adopt
these guidelines in full or adapt them according to their specific needs. It is also recommended that these
guidelines be updated periodically in response to new information on COVID-19.

Guidelines
