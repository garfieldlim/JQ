Dear Dr. Leslie:

Greetings!

Thank you for your request to use one of our Computer Laboratories this Saturday, August 10, from 8 am to 12 nn. We are pleased to inform you that we have approved your request and we wish you a successful event. Please coordinate with Ms. Carmela M. Tejana regarding the specific details such as the location of the laboratory and other matters that need to be settled before the actual day of the seminar.

We hope that this seminar will indeed help your students become more acquainted with technology and develop relevant skills that they can use in their future endeavors. Please feel free to approach us if you need further assistance.

Thank you and God bless!

Sincerely,

Dr. Gregg Victor D. Gabison
