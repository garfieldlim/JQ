Dear Fr. Alaras:

I am writing to inform your good office that I will not be able to report to my office duty on March 15, 2019 (Friday) and March 18, 2019 (Monday). Our family will be going on an out-of-the-country trip together with my husband's whole family. My sister-in-law who is based in Canada is sponsoring us for a family vacation in Hong Kong.

In this regard, I would like to request to be excused from my office duty during the aforementioned dates. Rest assured that all my tasks and responsibilities in the office as well as my academic load will not be affected because of my absence.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Chairman, CS/IT Department
