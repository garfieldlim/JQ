"Dear Dr. Cuizon:

Josenian Greetings!

| would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your constant support in all our department's endeavors. May our collaboration yield better opportunities for our Josenian students regardless of the department they came from.

| am writing this letter to ask for your approval regarding the use of one of the rooms of your department in the fourth floor of the SEM building - BRD 1. This October 25, 2019, from 9:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M., is our Departmental Examinations for Professional Education subjects for the First Semester Academic Year 2019-2020. We still lack one room to cater to seven subjects and sessions altogether. The BRD 1 room is ideal for our activity which is in the same floor as the other rooms of our college.

With this, I am attaching the letter approved by the VP Academics regarding the conduct of our Departmental Examinations. Rest assured that we will take charge of maintaining the cleanliness of the room after we use it on the day.

Again, thank you so much! Cor Unum in Deum!

Sincerely yours,
