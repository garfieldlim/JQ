Dear Rev. Fr. Persuz H. Decena, OAR,
Good day!

The Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) students of Eastern Visayas State University - Ormoc Campus will be having an Educational Tour in Cebu this May 30-June 1, 2023.

USJ-R School of Computer Studies, being one of the top information and communications technology (ICT) schools in the region, a Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Center of Excellence for IT Education, with PAASCU-accredited programs, and with several honors and accolades brought by its students and faculty members, is one of the ICT tour destinations of schools from other islands and provinces offering ICT programs.

EVSU - Ormoc Campus has requested to visit USJ-R SCS this June 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM in the Basak Campus. In this connection, we would like to request your permission that we allow the students and faculty of EVSU-Ormoc to conduct the visit.

As a CHED Center of Excellence in IT Education, it is also our responsibility to help other institutions and to inspire students to pursue their aspirations and do better in their chosen field, thereby improving the ICT human resource in the region.

Attached is the letter request of EVSU-Ormoc.

Your approval of this request is very much appreciated.

Thank you and Adelante!

Respectfully yours,
[Your Name]
