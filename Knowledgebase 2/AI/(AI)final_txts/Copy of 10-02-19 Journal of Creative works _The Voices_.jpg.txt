Dear Dr. Gabison,

The College of Arts and Sciences requests for the creation of a web address or URL for its journal “The Voices.” We suggest that the URL be “thevoices@usjr.edu.ph.” The journal will be launched sometime this October 2019.

We are hoping for your favorable response. Thank you.

Respectfully yours,
Glenn Pajares
Dean, College of Arts and Sciences
