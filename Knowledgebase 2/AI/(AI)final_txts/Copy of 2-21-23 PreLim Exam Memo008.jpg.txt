Dear Fr. Alipin,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request your approval of the attached Prelim Examination Schedule for the School of Computer Studies (SCS) at the University of San Jose-Recoletos for the second semester of academic year 2022-2023.

As per our new implementation of Milan Wednesday, we have adjusted our class schedule to Monday-Thursday (M-TH) and Tuesday-Friday (T-F). The SCS students will follow this new schedule for their SCS-offered course examinations, while SCS service courses, general education requirements, and minor courses will continue to follow the regular schedule provided by the Registrar's Office.

We would be grateful for your prompt approval of this request.

Thank you very much, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
Dean, School of Computer Studies
