Dear Dr. Victor Gabison,

I am writing to request for direct Wi-Fi access in all venues of the Professional Development Workshops for English Teachers that will be held on January 31-February 1, 2019 at the University of San Jose-Recoletos Main Campus. The workshops are in collaboration with the U.S. Department of State's Regional English Language Office and the University of the Philippines-Cebu.

The plenary session will be conducted through a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) via Skype or Zoom, while the breakout sessions will require internet access for interactive activities. Therefore, direct Wi-Fi access is crucial to ensure a smooth and successful event.

Please find attached an activity letter approved by our University President. We hope for your favorable response to this request.

Thank you very much for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Glenn Pajares
Dean, College of Arts and Sciences
