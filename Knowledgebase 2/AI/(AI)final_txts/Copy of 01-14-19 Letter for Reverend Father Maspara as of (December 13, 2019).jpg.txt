Dear Reverend Father Maspara:

I am pleased to inform you that the U.S. Department of Stateâ€™s Regional English Language Office is planning in collaboration with various institutions to hold Professional Development workshops and a conference for English teachers and students from USJ-R University of San Jose-Recoletos, University of the Philippines - Cebu, and other schools in Cebu. USJ-R has been selected as the venue for the event in consultation with Dr. Glenn Pajares. Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and College of Arts and Sciences at USJ-R. We have scheduled the conference which will be attended by 80 teachers and other invited guests for January 31, and February 1, 2019. The workshops and presentations will be delivered by 46 participants in our English Language Fellow Program, including Taraji Belaacem who is currently teaching at USJ-R.

For your awareness, English Language Fellows are U.S. English-language teaching professionals on teaching assignments at universities and other academic institutions around the world. Their assignments are 10-month full-time positions, and the Fellows hold graduate degrees in English-Language Teaching and have classroom teaching experience.

We are confident that the teachers and students from USJ-R, University of the Philippines - Cebu, and other schools in Cebu will greatly benefit from attending this conference. This is an outstanding opportunity for Professional Development.

Please contact me if you have any questions. You may reach me at Samuels@state.gov or 0908-8866697.

Sincerely,
Harold Samuels
Regional English Language Officer
