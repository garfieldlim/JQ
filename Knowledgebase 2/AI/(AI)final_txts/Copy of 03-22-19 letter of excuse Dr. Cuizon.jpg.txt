Good day!

I am writing to inform your good office that I will not be able to report to my office duty on March 15, 2019 (Friday) and March 18, 2019 (Monday). Our family will be going on an out-of-the-country trip together with my husband's whole family. My sister-in-law who is based in Canada is sponsoring us for a family vacation in Hong Kong.

In this regard, I would like to request to be excused from my office duty during the aforementioned dates. Rest assured that all my tasks and/or responsibilities in the office as well as my academic load will not be affected because of my absence.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

Chairman, CS/IT Department
