Greetings!

The Library System is submitting to your office the list of books selected by your faculty members during the Campus Book Fair last May 6 and 7, 2019 at the Main Library. Please advise them to visit the Library at their convenience and check on their recommended titles for us to process immediately.

Your continuing support is highly appreciated. Thank you and God bless.

Truly yours,
