Dear Fr. Estioko:

We are glad to inform you that we are organizing the CICCT Grand Alumni Homecoming on
February 22, 2020 at the Recoletos Coliseum in USJ-R Basak Campus with the theme “Aspire to
1.N.S.P.I.R.E.”. This is part of the celebration of the College Days of the College of Information,
Computer and Communications Technology (CICCT) of the University of San Jose-Recoletos.

For a meaningful celebration, the CICCT Alumni Homecoming will start with a Holy Mass. In
line with this, we would like to invite you to be our mass celebrant; leading us into worship and
uniting ourselves with the sacrifice of Christ.

Hoping for a positive response on this request.

Should you have questions, please feel free to let me know or thru Mr. Jeoffrey Gudio of the
CICCT Office, USJ-R Basak Campus at 4179511.

Thank you very much and Adelante!

Yours truly,

Marlito G. Cabigas
