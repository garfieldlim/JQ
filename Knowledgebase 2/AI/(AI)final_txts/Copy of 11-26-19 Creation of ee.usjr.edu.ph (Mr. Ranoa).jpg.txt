USJ — R Cebu City

Dear Rev. Fr. Sia:

Good day! We would like to request the creation of ee.usjr.edu.ph domain, hosting, and dedicated server from your good office. This is primarily intended for the department of Electrical Engineering's plan to reach out to more prospective students as well as to all USJ-R alumni. It will contain our projects and activities, announcements, and updates.

In order to secure and update the said web, Mr. Keith Vincent Ranoa, a second-year computer engineering student, volunteered to be the web developer of this project under the supervision of Engr. Piedad.

We look forward to your kind consideration of this request. Thank you.
