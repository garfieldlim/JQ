The request is being made through the efforts of the student/s and / or their representative.

Please be informed that the changes in the final grade will not affect the graduation status of the student/s as they have already graduated; however, it would be greatly appreciated if the university could honor this request for the improvement of the academic records of the students.

Thank you and more power!

Sincerely,
