Dear Sir/Madam:
Greetings from the ocean!

Cebu Ocean Park is the largest marine theme educational facility in the Queen City of the South, Cebu. Comprising various world-class exhibits and encounters, it aims to excite, educate, and thrill park-goers of all ages.

Cebu Ocean Park would like to impart its strong advocacy in marine conservation and preservation among the guests, especially students and educators, sculpting them to be responsible citizens of this nation, safeguarding the most important gifts granted by Mother Nature. Students will surely be delighted to experience featured rich marine biodiversity of the Philippines and other parts of the world. Visitors will have access to an enhanced knowledge about marine life, world of reptiles and insects, as well as intellectuals of winged beings.

In line with this, we would like to request your good office for an appointment at your most convenient time and to discuss further our partnership in creating a new breed of marine savers that will protect and preserve our marine life species and environment.

Thank you and hoping to hear from you soon.

Best regards,
