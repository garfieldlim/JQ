Magallanes St., Cebu City 600

Dear Mr. Bandalan,

I am writing this letter to formally request for grades on the following subjects: IT ELEC 2A S.Y. 2016-2017 and IT ELEC 3A S.Y. 18 Sem 2017-2018 marked with INC.

I wasn’t able to follow up on my grades marked with INC at the end of the semester, leading to this letter’s other purpose, verifying that I have completed all the necessary tasks/projects on time and in the same S.Y. indicated above.

Sincerely yours,

Jihrey L. Pingol
BS-IT Student
