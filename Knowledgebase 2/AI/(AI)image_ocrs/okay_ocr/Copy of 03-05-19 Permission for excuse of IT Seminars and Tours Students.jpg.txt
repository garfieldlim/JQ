SUBJECT: PERMISSION FOR EXCUSE OF IT SEMINARS AND TOURS STUDENTS

The students of the IT Seminars and Tours class of the College of ICCT, Second Semester, SY 2018-2019, has scheduled IT Tours on March 1, 8, 2019 (Fridays) in IT companies within Metro Cebu.

The IT Tour intends to provide our students:
- Exposure to the applications of the latest computer engineering
- Exposure to real IT industry set-up and work operations
- Career Choices with lives
- Self Assessment (extent of knowledge/skill for each)

In this connection, the undersigned would like t
Tours students be excused from their respective cl a

The tour is scheduled as such since most IT companies are not available on Fridays except for some irregular students who have MWF sessions.

Therefore, we would also request that they be given special exams or alternative assignments for any activity that they will be missing.

Your favorable consideration to this request will be highly appreciated.

Thank you. a >>>)
