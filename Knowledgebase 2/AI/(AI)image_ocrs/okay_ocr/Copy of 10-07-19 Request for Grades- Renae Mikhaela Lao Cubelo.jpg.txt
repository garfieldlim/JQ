University Registrar
Dear Fr. Alaras,

Greetings! I am Renae Mikhaela B. Lao Cubelo, a 4\({}^{\text{th}}\) year graduating student of College of Information, Computer and Communications Technology taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology specializing in Multimedia Applications Development. This is in regards to my INC grade in Capstone 1 of Summer 2018.

Mrs. Buctuanon has given us an extension to complete our requirements and we were able to defend our Capstone 1 project on the first week of June 2019. Unfortunately, our grade was not submitted right away considering that Mrs. Buctuanon was advised by her doctor to rest and take an early maternity leave.

In this regard, I would like to ask for your kind consideration that the change of final grade for my Capstone 1 course which was submitted by Mrs. Buctuanon last September 30, 2019 be accepted and posted on my account. This will be the last academic requirement that I need to facilitate in order for me to complete the BSIT program and hopefully join the graduation ceremonies this October 2019.

Thank you Father for looking into this matter and I am hoping for your affirmative response.

Thank you, God bless you and Adelante!

Respectfully,

Renae B. Lao Cubelo
