Since our students will also be actively involved in some of the activities, please excuse them from your classes; and if possible, they will be given assignments/tasks or make-up for the activities they will miss. These students will be provided with ATTENDANCE SLIPS which shall be presented to you as proof that they really participated.

Thank you for the usual support and consideration.
