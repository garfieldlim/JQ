Dear Father Alaras:

The Political Science and International Studies faculty of the Department of Social Sciences and Philosophy will be spearheading a lecture forum on the State of the Nation Address (SONA) of President Rodrigo Duterte on July 22, 2019 (Thursday), from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m. at the Center for Performing Arts. This event is free of charge.

The forum will have three (3) major talks on International Policy, Domestic Issues, and Church and State relationship. The organizers will invite speakers who are experts in their respective fields. This forum will be attended by the students of Political Science 1 classes and Political Science and International Studies major students.

I would like to request for your approval to conduct this meritorious activity. I would also like to ask permission from your office that the student participants will be excused from their classes and will be given a chance to complete all the requirements that they will miss.

I am hoping for your favorable response. Thank you for your continuous support.

Respectfully yours,

Glenn Pajares
Dean, College of Arts and Sciences
