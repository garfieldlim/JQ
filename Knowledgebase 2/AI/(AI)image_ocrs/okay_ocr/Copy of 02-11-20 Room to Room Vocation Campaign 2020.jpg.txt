Dear Fr Alaras: wat . SIT
Greetings in Christ!

We will celebrate our Vacation Days on February 11-14, 2020 with the theme:

Yosenni Youd Giffed ta Give and tu Testify te Love. This 4-day celebration aims to give our students the opportunity to discern and pray for vocations.

The activities will open with a Holy Mass on February 11, 2020 at 8:00 in the morning at the USJR-Basak Coliseum and will be culminated with a Vocation Symposium on February 14, 2020. We will also have a Room to Room Vocation Campaign to be conducted by priests and nuns of the Recollects and other religious congregations as well on February 12 & 13.

In this connection, we would like to ask for your good office to allow our visiting religious to conduct the said Room to Room Campaign to our college students (C/CCT & COE); Senior High School (Grade 12). Junior High School (Grade 19) classes from February 12-13 at 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.

We look forward to your positive response. May God bless us all as we journey with the young towards the path to Priesthood and become more mature Christians gifted to give and to testify to God who is Love.

Warm regards,

Ma. Rose G. Agatou
