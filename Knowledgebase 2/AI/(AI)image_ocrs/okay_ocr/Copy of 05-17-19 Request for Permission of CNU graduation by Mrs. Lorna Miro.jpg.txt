Dear Fr. Alaras:
I am proud to inform your office that I have successfully defended my Dissertation entitled "Alignment of SHS STEM and Tertiary ICT Curricula" as a graduation requirement for my course Doctor of Education Major in Educational Management at Cebu Normal University (CNU) last April 15.
Inasmuch as practices for the graduation ceremony are scheduled by CNU on May 16 and 21, and the graduation rites will be on May 23, 2019, I request permission to:
Hold my midterm exam on May 17 instead of May 16.
Be on leave from my class on May 21 and May 23.
May this request merit your consideration and approval. Thank you.
Faculty, CICCT
