Dear Colleagues,

We are delighted to invite you to the 2020 National Healthcare Executives Conference (NHEC) Summit. This year's conference will take place from September 15th through 17th at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Chicago. We believe that this event promises to be one of the most engaging and informative gatherings of healthcare professionals in recent memory, and we hope you can join us.

As you may know, NHEC is an annual conference that brings together leaders from across the healthcare industry, including physicians, nurses, administrators, and other healthcare executives. The goal of the summit is to provide attendees with opportunities to learn about emerging trends, best practices, and innovative approaches in healthcare management.

This year's theme for the Summit is "Navigating the Future of Healthcare." Our keynote speakers will discuss topics such as population health management, telehealth, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies that are transforming the delivery of care. In addition to our keynote speakers, we have a lineup of expert panelists who will share their insights on a range of important issues facing the healthcare industry today.

We understand that you may be busy with your daily responsibilities, but we hope you will consider attending this year's NHEC Summit. The conference promises to offer valuable networking opportunities and practical solutions for improving patient outcomes while controlling costs. And, as always, we are committed to making the event as accessible and affordable as possible, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns about registration or accommodation options.

We look forward to seeing you at the Summit!
