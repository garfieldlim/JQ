Dear department chairpersons and deans,

Good day!

Please allow the bearer of this note to ask for copies of your new curricular programs. We would like to file them in our office for easier reference. This is also for our needs analysis when you will be asking our help in the near future for Curriculum Quality Audit endeavors and all other teacher capacity trainings and workshops for your faculty, student organizations, and even extension activities. Our department is very much willing to assist you in any way we can.

May we continue to foster the Josenian collaborative spirit! You may contact us at dote@usjr.edu.ph or (032) 417-9500 local 1718.

Thank you so much for your constant support to our department. Cor Unum in Deum!

Sincerely,

Dr. Jeedonl P Babia, LPT

Dean
