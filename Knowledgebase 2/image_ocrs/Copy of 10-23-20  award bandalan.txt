Mr. Roderick A. Bandalan
‘School of Computer Studies

Dear Mr. Bandalan:

Congratulations! You are one of the awardees this year for having rendered 15 years of
service to the University.

Since we cannot hold the USI-R RECOGNITION NIGHT this year because of the
‘present pandemic, the School Board has approved the following scheme:

1. The cash incentive for the awardees will be deposited directly to their payroll
accounts on October 30, 2020.

2. The plaque and other items due to the awardees and retirees will be given to
‘them during the 2021 Recognition Night.

3. The awardees and retirees this year wil be given due recognition through the
University’s official website and social media platforms.

For the safety and protection of everyone, the School Board is confident you will
understand why we cannot hold the recognition night for this year.

Stay safe and God bless!
Truly yours,
