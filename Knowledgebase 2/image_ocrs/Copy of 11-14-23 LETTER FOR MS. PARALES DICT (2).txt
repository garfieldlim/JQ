Dear Fr. Alipin:
Good day!

We are happy to inform you that one of our students, MS. ALEXIS J. PARALES
a 3°-year BS IT student, took the honor of representing USJ-R at the DICT Hack4Gov
Finals, as a member of the wildcard team “Captcha” last October 16, 2023, in
Manila. Based on the individual scoring result, Ms. Parales managed to come out
as one of the overall Performance Excellence Awardees in the entire com n
This feat gave her the opportunity, along with other three exceptional students ‘0
represent the Philippines on the international stage.

With this, Ms. Parales was invited to be part of the team that will bear the
country’s flag in the 1st ASEAN Cybershield (ACS) Hacking Contest (ACS CON)
scheduled this November 21-24, 2023 at Jakarta, Indonesia.

In this regard, we would like to request your approval that Ms. Parales be
allowed to participate in this international competition and that the university give
its full support as she brings pride to the university and to the country.

Your approval of this request is very much appreciated.

Thank you very much. Adelante!
