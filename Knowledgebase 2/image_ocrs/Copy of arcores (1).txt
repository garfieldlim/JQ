TO ALL RELIGIOUS OF THE PROVINCE OF ST. EZEKIEL MORENO
Attention: Local CSEC-R Anchors

Dear Brothers:
Greetings of peace and Joy!

Responding to the call of the Church to be present in the peripheries, and to be creators of communion who
are committed to a change of a lifestyle (institutional, communitarian and personal), the religious of the
Province of St. Ezekiel Moreno assume “a committed conscience... to take on a preferential option for the
poor, for the family, and for life, [and for the environment] making decisions concerning appropriate
responses in evangelization and in pastoral work from a shared process of discernment” (cf. Rule 5.2; Const.,
282).

This commitment will be made manifest in the coming ARCORES HEART SOLIDARITY CAMPAIGN 2019-
2020 on February 5-6, 2020, at the University of San Jose-Recoletos, Cebu City, Philippines. The two-day
event organized by the ARCORES Filipinas, the implementing arm of the Social apostolates of the entire
province, will be participated in by representatives of different Recollect communities of the Philippines as
well as the AR sisters and lay collaborators.
