Subject: CAS CONVOCATION

The college is scheduled to have the CONVOCATION on July 17, 2019 (Wednesday), 8:00
a.m.-12:00 noon at the Center for Performing Arts. In the afternoon, the students will have
their organizational meetings at 2:00 — 5:00.

Since our students will also be actively involved in some of the activities, please excuse
them from your classes; and if possible, they will be given assignments/tasks or make-up for the
activities they will miss. These students will be provided with ATTENDANCE SLIPS which shall
be presented to you as proof that they really participated.

Thank you for the usual support and consideration.
