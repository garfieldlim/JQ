Dear Fr. Maspara:

USJ-R CICCT, being an active partner of Alliance Software Inc., is requested

Part of the request is for Dr. Jovelyn Cuizon to serve as the Review Master

Employment sessions and In-Campus Recruitment Activities.

In this regard, we would like to seek for your approval that we be allowed to
host the venue of the said review class as scheduled.

Your favorable response to this request is very much appreciated.

Thank you very much and Adelante!

Sincerely yours,

FG
