Dear Dr. Gabison:

Greetings of peace!

With reference to the offering of the new program Bachelor of Science in Medical Technology,
the course Health Information System for Med Lab Science is offered every first semester.
Hence, students will be paying for its laboratory fees as the course requires the use of

computers and we do not have a computer room assigned to our College.

It is in this aspect that we would like to request from your office to provide or allow us to use
one (1) computer room for the aforementioned class starting July of A.Y. 2020-2021.

We suggest, with your permission, to have us use the room on the specified day and time as
mentioned below:

Term

First Semester 4:30-5:30 pm
AY 2020-2021

Thank you very much for your attention and | look forward to your approval.

Respectfully yours,
Dr. Au . Verano

Dean
