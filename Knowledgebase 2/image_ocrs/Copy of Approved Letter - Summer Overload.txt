Dear Fr. Alaras:

Salve Maria!

For many years, we have allowed our students to enroll a maximum of nine (9) units during sui
allow them to catch up on failed subjects, or to get ahead of schedule by enrolling minor subjec:

summer so they can focus more on their major subjects during the regular semesters.
however, students have yet to apply for overload if they intend to enroll summer subjects tha
the allowed number of summer units stipulated in their curriculum.

In this connection, we would like to propose that students be allowed to enroll a maximum of
units during summer without anymore applying for overload, subject to pre-evaluation
respective faculty advisers and without prejudice to compliance with the required prerequisite
from streamlining the enrollment process and helping our students complete their program
this will also generate additional summer income for the school as well as additional teaching |
our faculty.

Thank you very much and we are hoping for a favorable response to this request.

Respectfully yours,
