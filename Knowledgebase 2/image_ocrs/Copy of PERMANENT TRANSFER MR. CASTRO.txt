Dear Fr. Celiz:

The School of Computer Studies (SCS) would like to request the approval of the
permanent transfer of a Senior High School faculty member, MR. BENEDICT M.
CASTRO, effective this First Semester, SY 2022-2023.

Mr. Castro started as a Full-time Probationary Faculty at the Senior High School
Department in February of 2018. He was temporarily transferred to the School of Computer
Studies during the First Semester of SY 2021-2022.

Furthermore, we request that the counting of his probationary status be continued as
he transferred to the School of Computer Studies.

We look forward to your final approval.

Thank you very much. Adelante!
