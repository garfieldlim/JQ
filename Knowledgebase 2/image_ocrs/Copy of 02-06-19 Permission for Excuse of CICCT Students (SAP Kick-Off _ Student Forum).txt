SUBJECT: PERMISSION FOR EXCUSE OF ALL CICCT STUDENTS

The College of ICCT will hold the following activities this February 8, 2019
(Friday) at the SEM Audio Visual Room, USJ-R Basak Campus:

Student Advisorship Program Kick-Off 1:00 — 3:00 PM

CICCT Student Forum 3:00 — 5:00 PM

The SAP Kick-off will introduce new students and re-introduce the older students
to their new or current advisers; revisit expectations; discuss about the schemes that will
be implemented for the monitoring of students’ academic performance, as well as the
different schedules that teachers may be reached by the students for guidance. The
forum intends to confer with the students about the pressing concerns that need to be

clarified and the different updates that the college would want the students to be aware
of.

In this connection, the undersigned would like to request that all CICCT students
be excused from their respective classes during the said activities.

Furthermore, we would also request that they be given special exams or alternative
assignments for any activity that they will miss during the event.

Your favorable consideration to this request will be highly appreciated.
