In this connection, we would like to request your college/department to excuse
the said students from their classes and academic activities on May 11, 2019 at
NOVOTEL, Quezon City. The team will be attending an Innovation Bootcamp for the
Top 20 teams which includes a meet-up with Accenture mentors, attend a Design
Thinking session to fine tune their innovation idea and at the end of the day, present the
final concept to the judges for the Top 10 Finalists selection,

Furthermore, we would also request that they be given special exams or alternative
assignments for any activity that they will miss during the said event.

Your favorable consideration to this request is highly appreciated.

Thank you very much. Adelante!

Sa Che Fearon,
DR. GREGG VICTOR D. GABISON
Dean, College of ICCT
