Dear Sir/Madam;
Greetings from the ocean!

Cebu Ocean Park is the largest marine theme educational facility in the Queen City of the South,
Cebu. Comprising various world class exhibits and encounters, it aims to excite, educate, and thrill
park-goers of all ages.

Cebu Ocean Park would like to impart its strong advocacy in marine conservation and
preservation among the guests, especially students and educators, sculpting them to be responsible
citizens of this nation, safe guarding the most important gifts granted by mother nature. Students will
surely be delighted to experience featured rich marine biodiversity of the Philippines and other parts of
the world. Visitors will have access to an enhanced knowledge about marine life, world of reptiles and
insects, as well as intellectuals of winged beings.

In line with this we would like to request your good office for an appointment in your most
convenient time and to discuss further our partnership in creating a new breed of marine savers that will

protect and preserve our marine life species and environment,

Thank you and hoping to hear from you soon.

Best regards,
