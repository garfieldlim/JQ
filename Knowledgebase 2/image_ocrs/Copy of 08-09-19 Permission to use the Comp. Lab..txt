Dear Dr. Gabison:
A pleasant day!

| would like to ask permission from your office to use one of your Computer Laboratories here in USJR
Main Campus this Saturday, August 10, from 8 am to 12 nn. This is in line with my Research Classes for
both International Studies (IS18) and Political Science (PolSci 23). | have also asked one of your college
faculty, Mr. Eric V. Magto, to conduct a seminar on Computer Literacy, focusing on Data Collection and
Interpretation using MS Excel, and other software/programs which students may use in their research.

| suggested and initiated this seminar since | wanted my students to utilize technology as much as possible
because, at the end of the day, this will also be convenient for them. | believe that through this seminar,
my research students will not only be more acquainted with technology, but, at the same time, learn/re-

develop certain skills which will be very useful when they graduate from this institution.

| hope for your consideration. Thank you and God bless!

Sincerely,

Noted by:
