Dear Fr. Maspara:
Greetings!

Lam John Leeroy A. Gadiane, a faculty from the School of Computer Studies and
currently pursuing the Master of Science in Computer Science at the Cebu Institute
of Technology - University. | am a grantee of the CHED Scholarships for Graduate
Studies (SGS) starting June 2017 and was expected to complete the program last 2020.
‘As part of the program's requirement, to have my thesis presented at a technical
conference in computing,

| recently presented my research paper virtually at the 1st GCCRC (Global
Convergence Content Research Center) International Conference last May 7, 2021
‘at Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea. This conference was recommended by
my adviser and dean of the graduate school, Dr. Cherry Sta. Romana of CIT-U.
However, presenting at this conference will qualify more to the degree program of
Master of Computer Science.

In this regard and complying with the scholarship requirement, | am writing ths letter to
inform you of my intent and seek your approval to shift from Master of Science in
‘Computer Science (MSCS) to Master of Computer Science (MCS). The need to shift
is a recommendation of Dr. Sta Romana to complete my graduate program degree.
‘Thank you, father, for the favorable response to this request.

Adelante!

Best regards,
