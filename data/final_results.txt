Result 1: text: The outbreak of the COVID-19 has brought about tiring tasks and unending demands in the Philippine educational system. With the abrupt shift of the teaching-learning process, teachers are pressured and stressed, which leads them to be burned out. The descriptive correlational research design determines the direct and indirect effects of perceived control to burnout through teachersâ€™ personality traits of the 240 early childhood teachers. Data are analyzed using the Pearson r formula, Bivariate parametric correlation, and the Structural Equation Model (SEM). The study reveals that despite the challenges experienced in this time of pandemic, teachers have control over themselves and with the people around them. The teachersâ€™ level of control does not influence their burnout; instead, their burnout is dependent on their emotional stability. Thus, burnout is a personal choice which is triggered by oneâ€™s emotion. A person with high perceived control may still be burned out if he does not have control over his emotions. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/964 author: Andrian A.

Result 2: text: The need for resilience among educators has become a critical demand during the COVID-19 pandemic when in-person classes were restricted and were converted into distance learning and eventually shifted to blended learning as governments opened borders and health safety protocols eased down. Hence, this study focuses on understanding how educators of technology-based courses in public higher education across academic landscapes have navigated for continuous instructional delivery. This study utilizes the Straussian approach of Grounded Theory. This design uses a three-stage coding methodology: open, axial, and selective coding. The study generates the Theory of Educators Teaching Technology-Based Courses across academic landscapes, which postulates that educators in technology-based courses undergo phases of metamorphosis that include visioning, learning, rationalizing and doing, and modernizing, ultimately allowing them to become resilient and adaptive to the shifting landscapes of the academe caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1572 author: Leila Pinatil title: Theory of Adaptation of Educators Teaching Technology-Based Courses date: 2023-06-30 June 30 2023 links: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1572 media:  
Result 3: text: Employee retention is one of the human resource management (HRM) issues. This study determines the factors that significantly influence employee retention amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The study employs complete enumeration and uses primary data. After which, the results are analyzed using descriptive statistics and econometric modeling. Results reveal that employees are satisfied to do their respective jobs (M=4.09, SD=0.48). In addition, they show that the determinants such as other income (p-value=0.024), length of service (p-value=0.099), as well as reward and recognition (p-value=0.015), are significant influences to employeesâ€™ retention. Hence, these conclude that better remuneration (and the increase thereof) are more likely to retain existing employees and attract employees from other organizations. Furthermore, the study specifically recommends that employee retention be improved by further refining reward and recognition that surely meet the needs and well-being of the employees. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1070 author: Dennis T.

Result 4: text: This paper aims to analyze the interest generated in social media of posts that were originally, just local or national concerns; yet, in time, became global phenomena. It studies two recent phenomena: the Arab Spring and Psysâ€™ Gangnam Style which demonstrate the transformative power of social media. Using secondary online data through data mining method, it looked into the Arab Spring incident and the popular video of Psy â€œThe Gangnam Style, â€œ which is a global Â sensation. Results reveal the spread of popularity across the world of the two from being mere national phenomena. Â This validates the theory used in this study. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/127 author: Jose D. Velez Jr., Mark N.

Result 6: text: The pandemic disrupts the functioning of most sectors and exposes the shortcomings and vulnerabilities among many. Literature search in leading databases reveals that though shocked by the crisis, many industries and organizations have reinvented themselves through various strategies to overcome the consequences of the pandemic. After a thorough analysis of individual articles, the authors found out that human resource management considers the disruptive changes in the working pattern, challenges, and opportunities ahead and makes appropriate changes to create an efficient workforce for the future with the help of technology that has become an inevitable companion in human resource management and not a panacea for uncertainties and crises ahead. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1087 author: Binoy Mathew K V, Maryelizabeth Tidiya Walarine title: Human Resource Management: Pre-pandemic, Pandemic and Beyond date: 2022-01-28 January 28 2022 links: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1087 media:  
Result 7: text: This exploratory study aims to discuss the multifaceted challenges and opportunities of the Philippine tourism industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges and opportunities are organized by following the elements of anti-pandemic strategies in the COVID-19 Management Framework. Some pressing challenges are the decline in tourism demand, layoff of workers, demand for online/digital transactions, avoidance of tourists to occupy hotel rooms used as quarantine facilities, and compliance of disaster management and control preparedness protocols. However, tourism industry can thrive through ample opportunities like exploring local tourism, training employees on digital services and on safety protocols, rebuilding company brand, improving business facilities, adapting to modern technology, and collaborating with consultants on disaster and risk management. These challenges and opportunities provide the bases for suggestions and recommendations
to improve policies for future pandemic planning to cushion any potential impact on the tourism industry. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1071 author: Deoan D.

Result 8: text: The study aimed to develop a software application to capture tourist activity information, extract movement patterns from the dataset through sequential pattern mining (SPM), and visualize spatiotemporal movement. Tourist activity information was captured through crowdsourced trajectory movements by scanning unique QR (Quick Response) codes for each visited tourist spots. The AprioriAll algorithm was used to find frequent trajectory patterns on tourist visits. The resulting maximal k-sequences and their subsequences represent the recommended trip itinerary. The spatial and temporal movements were visualized through a flow map and a heat map, respectively. The directed edges in the flow map show the recommended sequence of tourist sites to visit. The heat map shows the density of tourist visits in different areas at time intervals. The application was validated with selected tour planning experts to verify functional suitability, usability, and acceptability. Experimental results show positive indicators that the application met the usersâ€™ expectations. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/965 author: Maria Isabel R.

Result 9: text: The study aims to assess the extent of social media usage in talent acquisition in IT/BPM companies in Cebu and evaluate the insights of the applicants on the practice of using social media in character assessment for hiring decision. The quantitative method was employed to obtain data from two groups of respondents which constitute thirty hiring managers and ninety-six applicants. The study found that while hiring managers moderately practice social media background check to obtain additional information about the applicant, they seldom used it in hiring decisions because of the lack of formal or informal policy allowing or restricting the use of social media for that purpose. It is also found that there is a significant difference in perception between hiring managers and prospective applicants on usergenerated content on candidate social media profile. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/631 author: Jovelyn C Cuizon title: Assessing Applicant Employability Using Social Media for Talent Acquisition and Recruitment in IT/BPM Companies date: 2019-06-06 June 06 2019 links: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/631 media:  
Result 10: text: This study aims to use social media data as corpus to assess personâ€™s character to provide a preliminary background check on job seekers. It will provide recruiters an initial assessment of the candidates as well as supplementary information to support traditional recruitment and talent acquisition activities thereby reducing time and cost spent for character investigation. The application uses social media analytics to assign a social profile score. Unstructured text data are preprocessed to include only keywords which are relevant to the analysis. Word sense disambiguation is applied to determine the underlying meaning of the words. The bag-of-word is then checked for occurrence of associated words defined for each factor. Posts containing at least one occurrence of words associated with the factors are further tested for content polarity. Social character score is computed using proposed formula. The system recommends applicants based on skills and uses social character score for relevancy ranking of candidates relative to the job posts. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/245 author: Jovelyn Cuizon, Kent Ferolino title: Social Media Character Assessment for Talent Selection using Natural Language Processing date: 2017-10-11 October 11 2017 links: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/245 media:
