With the abrupt shift of the teaching-learning process, teachers are pressured and stressed, which leads them to be burned out. The descriptive correlational research design determines the direct and indirect effects of perceived control to burnout through teachersâ€™ personality traits of the 240 early childhood teachers. Data are analyzed using the Pearson r formula, Bivariate parametric correlation, and the Structural Equation Model (SEM). The study reveals that despite the challenges experienced in this time of pandemic, teachers have control over themselves and with the people around them. The teachersâ€™ level of control does not influence their burnout; instead, their burnout is dependent on their emotional stability. Thus, burnout is a personal choice which is triggered by oneâ€™s emotion. A person with high perceived control may still be burned out if he does not have control over his emotions. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/964', 'text_id': 'd940566f-1d0a-4981-a3cc-6069057e6c36', 'media': ' '}, {'link': 'https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/127', 'uuid': '2386f3ae-0b85-4b14-a64a-8ca52f21ddf8', 'text': 'This paper aims to analyze the interest generated in social media of posts that were originally, just local or national concerns; yet, in time, became global phenomena.

The study found that while hiring managers moderately practice social media background check to obtain additional information about the applicant, they seldom used it in hiring decisions because of the lack of formal or informal policy allowing or restricting the use of social media for that purpose.

The main task attained in the study was the determination of the pediculicidal effects of Annona squamosa seed extract of different concentrations. Methodology utilized a true experimental design done in 3 trials; 10 live head lice were observed under each concentration of 25%, 50%, 75% atis seeds extract for the experimentation and 75% permethrin concentration as controlled group. In vitro testing was used and the subjects were placed in prepared petri dishes for experimentation. Data results found out that there is p-value of 0.067 at Î± = 0.05 for mean time elapsed (secs) for 100% head lice mortality. Significant p-level of 0.002 for pediculicidal activity for the first 5 minutes has been noted. The researchers derived up with a conclusion that Custard Apple (Annona squamosa) seed extract in 75%, 50% and 25% concentration is as effective as Commercial Pediculicide (Permethrin) in killing pediculosis Capitis. 50% concentration has comparable results to Permethrin and is the most effective due to its earlier onset of pediculicidal activity. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/109', 'text_id': '88308d34-8df3-4423-8a99-8ac2fe9113cb', 'media': ' '}, {'link': 'this is the text', 'uuid': '35f57fa0-6afe-462f-aba6-984c122cff84', 'text': 'This is the title', 'text_id': '35f57fa0-6afe-462f-aba6-984c122cff84', 'media': ''}, {'link': 'https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/23', 'uuid': '3b28ef3f-8f50-4361-90c9-74ba306cbd1e', 'text': 'This study is an empirical validation of the economic and environmental parameters of tourism in the Philippines.

The researcher utilized a path analysis to determine which among the tourism factors had a robust effect by the tropical depression. This study also concludes the effects (both direct and indirect) of predictors to GDP. A model was established from the predictors (x) to its response (y). To demonstrate the paths from the origin to the end, a computed path coefficients were generated. The summation of value effects was determined and an effect model was established. Findings revealed that travel price factor was a prevalent element that influenced the volatility of GDP and not more on the tourist arrivals and tourism employment rate. Tourists, regardless of nationality, prefer to spend more their money, enjoy and mesmerize the natural beauty of Philippines even with the occurrence of natural disturbances.

Confirmatory analysis using Kendall’s tau-B showed a strong correlation between PS and TS I (creativity-generating style), implying that it plays a prominent role in professional skepticism. Contrary to earlier studies, our study found only a moderate correlation between TS II (norm-favoring style) and PS.
