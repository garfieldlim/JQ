Estioko, OAR was born in Negros Occidental and was raised in Bacolod City. He finished Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering at the University of West Negros.\n\nIn 1984, he entered the seminary. According to him, he first applied for the Oblate of Mary Immaculate (OMI) but was not accepted. “One of the OAR priests knew what happened and told me to take a test for the OAR congregation in Casiciaco in Baguio,” he recalled.\n\nThen, he was ordained as a priest on 1991. He then served as the school treasurer at the University of Negros Oriental-Recoletos (UNO-R) from 1991-1997.  After, he taught Agri-Engineering back in UNO-R.\n\nFast forward, he was assigned as a Novitiate Master in Antipolo from 2015-2018.\n\nOn the lighter side, Fr. Estioko enjoys painting and had produced at least 10 creations with subjects like still life, landscape, and portraits.\n\n“For me, painting is therapeutic. Things I couldn’t tell my brothers, I can express in painting,” he explained.\n\nThe new VP Finance is also into pastel colors and RnB particularly highlighting his fondness of the song Price Tag by an English singer and songwriter Jessie J.\n\nWhen asked of his favorite movie, he was fast to rejoin the cartoon character Popeye, Tarzan, and Lion-King.\n\nAs a local prior, he emphasized that the primary focus should be prayer life. “We are here to live a life of holiness; we are not only here as administrators,” he said. In the university, he aims to strengthen the Leccio Divina. It is a traditional Benedictine practice of scriptural reading, meditation, and prayer intended to promote communion with God and to increase the knowledge of God’s Word. “I want the (accounting) staff here to not only focus on numbers, but they should also have hearts: to know how to feel and learn how to care,” he said.\n\n \n\n[Words of Wisdom for Josenians]\n“We are persons with faculties: mind and emotions, it should be balanced.” \n\nname: Rev.

At the same time, he was also the school chaplain who administered the daily mass and students’ monthly recollection. He also taught Religion education to senior high school students in 2016.\n\n \n\nOn a lighter note, Fr. Baluarte is a fan of Latino music, particularly of the Spanish artist Enrique Iglesias. He also shared that he really likes sky blue because it is a Marian hue.\n\nSurprisingly, he is not into movies and would rather choose reflection books for pastime. Moreover, he is into table tennis for physical exercise.\n\n“Sports is about a lot of things. It can help one release tension, develop a healthy lifestyle, bond with friends, and aids for formation character,” he explained.\n\nAs the new VP for Religious Affairs, he advises the students to value their studies.\n\n“As students, even if you’re driven by so many passion, learn to prioritize, focus, and sacrifice,” he said.\n\nHe also envisions centralization for scholarship and to strengthen the university’s athletics particularly enhance the skills of the athletes.\n\n \n\n[Words of Wisdom for Josenians]\n“Let our knowledge beyond scaffolding, beyond edifice.”\n\nname: Rev.
