Adelante!  #SEDexcellence #USJRat75 #TakingYouForwardSince1947 #JosenianEducators\", \"SED Recognizes Outstanding Josenian Educators in Caritas Ceremony  In grateful recognition for the individuals who positively impacted the college throughout the academic year, the School of Education of the University of San Jose-Recoletos held the eighth \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u009cCaritas et Scientia Leadership Awards\\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u009d last May 10, 2023, at the USJ-R Basak Coliseum.  Starting things off, Dr. Jestoni P. Babia, Dean of the School of Education, provided the opening remarks and noted the various achievements, as well as the significant challenges that lay ahead, within the college. He underscored that while SED has come this far regarding its innumerable accomplishments and milestones, important opportunities must be addressed and managed. He looked forward to future leadership having the creativity, initiative, and resourcefulness to fill the gaps and further enhance the enormously magnificent reputation SED has already carved out for itself. As a very important note, SED has maintained its gold-standard status as a Center of Excellence for Teacher Education, exemplifying its prestige as a go-to place for aspiring teachers who want nothing less than quality pedagogical instruction and training.  Multiple and various awards were given to both the students and faculty members. The awards night capped a yearlong grind by teachers and students who slugged it out against the numerous PowerPoint presentations, learning modules, reviews, reports, grades, and so much other paperwork they had to accomplish against a myriad of deadlines. In the end, the sleepless nights and seemingly bottomless iced coffee cups were all worth it \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u0093 all for the sake of ensuring that both sides obtain the education and learning that would not only serve them well in the four corners of the classroom \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u0093 but in the contextualized reality of a continually unpredictable world. After all, Josenian Educators do not just teach; they inspire.
