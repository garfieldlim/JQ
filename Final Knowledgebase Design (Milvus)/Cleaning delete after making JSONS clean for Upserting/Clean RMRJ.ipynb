De Catalina, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.01, abstract: St. John\\'s Gospel begins with a prologue, serving as an overture to the whole Gospel. This paper investigates the philosophical notions embedded in the first three lines of John 1:1. The inquiry focuses on whether or not the accepted meaning of this line as \"indicating timeless existence\" can be deduced from John 1:1 and whether or not John 1:1 also indicates the meaning of the \"principle of creation.\" This paper proceeds to make this inquiry in the following order: Introduction; The questions arising in John 1:1; Word as God is eternal, outside time; \"In the beginning\" as predicate; \"The Word was in the beginning\"; Timeless existence and the verb was; The Word as God is a principle of creation (which included the distinction between the concepts of anthropological intentionality and metaphysical intentionality); and Conclusion.

Hagonob, Leomarich F. Casinillo, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.01.04, abstract: This study is about the generated electricity from wastewater using carbon electrodes with the absence/presence of salt bridge through the biofilm anode of the microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology. The three wastewater samples used were from a pond, an abaca pulp mill, and rice fields. Results showed that one of the abaca pulp mill treatments, using carbon rod electrodes with salt bridge presence, reached the highest mean voltage and current to 578.7 mV and 0.2022 mV, respectively. The study revealed that the number of sensible power generation days, from start to end of experimentation, has a significant difference between treatments. Throughout the 20-day fermentation process, a total count of 8.94x105 colony forming units (CFU) per ml was found and purified from the biofilm anodes from pond wastewater. Likewise, 9.14x105 CFU per ml isolates from the abaca pulp mill, and 1.65x106 CFU per ml isolates from the rice field., published date: 2021-05-28, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1011, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 9 No. 1',\n",

De Catalina, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.01, abstract: St. John\\'s Gospel begins with a prologue, serving as an overture to the whole Gospel. This paper investigates the philosophical notions embedded in the first three lines of John 1:1. The inquiry focuses on whether or not the accepted meaning of this line as \"indicating timeless existence\" can be deduced from John 1:1 and whether or not John 1:1 also indicates the meaning of the \"principle of creation.\" This paper proceeds to make this inquiry in the following order: Introduction; The questions arising in John 1:1; Word as God is eternal, outside time; \"In the beginning\" as predicate; \"The Word was in the beginning\"; Timeless existence and the verb was; The Word as God is a principle of creation (which included the distinction between the concepts of anthropological intentionality and metaphysical intentionality); and Conclusion. This paper concludes by affirming the two questions on timeless existence and the principle of creation., published date: 2022-05-25, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/986, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1',\n",

This paper investigates the extent of practice of graduate attributes among graduating college students of a Catholic University. It determines the influence of graduate attributes in studentsâ€™ lives. Using a sequential explanatory mixed-method design, the findings revealed that the participants developed the graduate attributes to a high extent. Remarkable implication signifies that university education has successfully prepared and trained students to meet the challenges of national and global employment and industry. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/25',\n",

       " 'text': 'St. John\\'s Gospel begins with a prologue, serving as an overture to the whole Gospel. This paper investigates the philosophical notions embedded in the first three lines of John 1:1. The inquiry focuses on whether or not the accepted meaning of this line as \"indicating timeless existence\" can be deduced from John 1:1 and whether or not John 1:1 also indicates the meaning of the \"principle of creation.\" This paper proceeds to make this inquiry in the following order: Introduction; The questions arising in John 1:1; Word as God is eternal, outside time; \"In the beginning\" as predicate; \"The Word was in the beginning\"; Timeless existence and the verb was; The Word as God is a principle of creation (which included the distinction between the concepts of anthropological intentionality and metaphysical intentionality); and Conclusion. This paper concludes by affirming the two questions on timeless existence and the principle of creation. link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/986',\n",

      "St. John's Gospel begins with a prologue, serving as an overture to the whole Gospel. This paper investigates the philosophical notions embedded in the first three lines of John 1:1. The inquiry focuses on whether or not the accepted meaning of this line as \"indicating timeless existence\" can be deduced from John 1:1 and whether or not John 1:1 also indicates the meaning of the \"principle of creation.\" This paper proceeds to make this inquiry in the following order: Introduction; The questions arising in John 1:1; Word as God is eternal, outside time; \"In the beginning\" as predicate; \"The Word was in the beginning\"; Timeless existence and the verb was; The Word as God is a principle of creation (which included the distinction between the concepts of anthropological intentionality and metaphysical intentionality); and Conclusion. This paper concludes by affirming the two questions on timeless existence and the principle of creation.\n",
      "This study aimed to determine the ratooning ability of lowland rice to production management practices. It assessed the profitability of rice ratooning to the abovementioned objectives. The experiment was set out in a split-plot organized in a Randomized Complete Block Design with production management practices as the main plot and cutting heights of ratoon crop as the subplot treatment. Production management practices notably affected all agronomic characteristics, yield, and yield component parameters evaluated except the grain yield. Cutting height remarkably influenced all growth and yield parameters tested except panicle weight. Economic analysis revealed that the improved method achieved a higher gross margin (PHP21,321.60) than the farmerâ€™s practice (PHP15,419.40) because of the formerâ€™s high productivity (1.64 t ha-1). A cutting height of 45.0 cm under the improved method obtained the highest gross margin (PHP28,677.00). Moreso, this approach is considered a good measure in adapting to the problematic scenario relative to climate change.\n",
      "This phenomenological research was conducted to inquire into the experiences of fathers of children with autism during the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study was explored because there is a dearth of studies focusing on paternal involvement and a lack of local autism research. Nine participants, who were chosen using purposive sampling, individually participated in an unstructured interview. The van Kaam method popularized by Moustakas was used to analyze the data gathered. Five major themes emerged: recognizing the child's needs, surviving hardships, enduring exhaustion, encountering silver linings, and moving forward. The findings showed that fathers of children with autism encountered challenging and fulfilling events during the pandemic with resilience. Fathers of children with autism prioritized familial needs, especially of the child, and increased their presence in the household. A strong paternal character builds up fathersâ€™ resilience in coping with the difficulties of raising a child with autism in a precarious time.\n",
      "This paper inquires into the problems concerning Filipino values and moral norms. Based on the interviews with the social science and philosophy scholars and the youth leaders in the Philippines, the study identifies the following problems: Filipino identity, distortion and dysfunctionalization, manifold ambivalence, dissonance, false justification and misuse, cynicism, and decline of moral courage. Analyzed based on Hans Kelsenâ€™s concept of validity and efficacy, the problems prove to be radical given that the purported Filipino values system is actually a chaotic constellation of competing and conflicting pre-colonial, colonial, and postcolonial normative paradigms. Distorted, ambivalent, and dysfunctionalized, Filipino values and norms fail to provide effective normative guidelines. The proposed antidote of moral and values education is bound to be futile in the face of a severely mutilated social conscience.\n",
      "This descriptive-correlational study assesses the psycho-spiritual well-being of junior high school students at Catholic Schools in Central Philippines. Also, it determines the relationship between the said constructs, and at the same, their association between the variables of sex, family structure, birth order, religious affiliation, and church involvement. The data are gathered using Ryffâ€™s Psychological Well-being and Ellison and Paloutzianâ€™s Spiritual Well-being Scale. The findings reveal moderate levels of psychological and spiritual well-being among the respondents. Point biserial shows that a significant relationship existed between the demographics of family structure and psychological well-being and between church involvement and psychological well-being. Rank biserial shows, on the other hand, that there is a significant relationship between family structure and spiritual well-being and between church involvement and spiritual well-being. Also, Spearman Rank Correlation results indicated that there is a relationship between psychological well-being and spiritual well-being.\n",
      "Let G be an additive group of order v, D be a non-empty proper k-subset of G, and λ be any integer. Then D is a (v, k, λ) - difference set if every nonzero element of the group can be expressed as a difference d1 - d2 of elements of D in exactly λ ways. Let q be a prime of the form q = nN + 1 for integers n>1 and N>1. For q<1000, this study shows the construction of difference sets in the additive group of the field GF(q) from unions of cyclotomic classes of order N = 14 using a computer search. The construction consisted of computer programs derived from the definitions and theorems on difference sets using Python. The results revealed that only the union of seven cyclotomic classes such as C0(14, q) U C2(14, q) U C4(14, q) U C6(14, q) U C8(14, q) U C10(14, q) U C12(14, q) forms a quadratic cyclotomic difference set. Similarly, this union together with zero forms a difference set equivalent to the modified quadratic cyclotomic difference sets.\n",
      "Governance has become an increasingly important factor in the investment decisions of firms and investors. Thus, it is important to determine the quality and composition of corporate boards, which are vital overseers who act in the best interests of shareholders to improve and strengthen them. While interlocking directorates are not a recent occurrence in the Philippines, updated literature on the structure of the countryâ€™s board interlock network is sparse. Thus, this study provides a baseline snapshot by analyzing all 251 publicly-listed companies on the Philippine Stock Exchange at the director and board levels. More so, the study utilizes social network analysis tools to describe the properties of interlocking directorates and visually maps out the social network that underpins these relationships. It reveals that the board network is extensive, with almost 90% of firms connected, thanks to a handful of key directors who have high degrees of connectivity.\n",
      "For generations, folk medicines have been used to cure various diseases with supernatural and naturalistic causations. With ethnographic descriptive design, mananambals, Tambal Binisaya vendors, and loyal patrons served as key informants in this qualitative study. In obtaining the data, observations, field notes, and interviews were the main instruments used to investigate inculturation, which is the underlying phenomenon behind the folk Catholicism evident in Tambal Binisaya. As such, it was revealed that there are strong pieces of evidence of pre-Christian practices in Tambal Binisaya, such as belief in abyans, balance in natural elements in the body, and even animism, which are somehow divergent from Catholic beliefs that put a premium on God and the total healing of the mind, body, and spirit. Despite these differences, Tambal Binisaya somehow integrated these aspects of the two systems into a hybrid healing practice. The indigenous have indeed been married to Catholicism in Tambal Binisaya.\n",
      "Employee retention is one of the human resource management (HRM) issues. This study determines the factors that significantly influence employee retention amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The study employs complete enumeration and uses primary data. After which, the results are analyzed using descriptive statistics and econometric modeling. Results reveal that employees are satisfied to do their respective jobs (M=4.09, SD=0.48). In addition, they show that the determinants such as other income (p-value=0.024), length of service (p-value=0.099), as well as reward and recognition (p-value=0.015), are significant influences to employeesâ€™ retention. Hence, these conclude that better remuneration (and the increase thereof) are more likely to retain existing employees and attract employees from other organizations. Furthermore, the study specifically recommends that employee retention be improved by further refining reward and recognition that surely meet the needs and well-being of the employees.\n",
      "Science research culture in basic education can be associated with science investigatory projects (SIPs). In relation to this, the paper establishes a theory on the development of SIP culture in basic education utilizing theory generation through axiomatic deductive approach based on steps prescribed by R. Padua (personal communication, November 17, 2014) which creates the theory that basic education institutions contribute to high productivity in SIPs. Simply because humans and non-human resources along with quality Science instruction are needed to yield such productivity. These attributes, resources, and Science instruction foster SIP culture. These are crucial aspects as schools capacitate students and teachers, produce the SIPs, and eventually disseminate these projects in science fairs.\n",
      "Garden-based education (GBE) is an innovative approach to enhancing learnersâ€™ academic performance. However, the mechanism of how it develops the cognitive domain of learning is unclear. This meta-synthesis of 22 published articles focusing on garden-based education integration in the educative process examined its impact on mental aspects of learning. Secondary data from each reviewed article were extracted and analyzed thematically. Five themes emerged describing the impact of GBE on the cognitive domain of learning, namely, 1) experiential learning, 2) meaningful learning, 3) explicit and implicit learning, 4) discovery learning, and 5) transmissible learning. GBE is a successful program in most of the basic education curriculum integration contributing to the improvement of academic performance. Albeit, there is no standard template for its implementation as it varies across context and educational system, adopting the general principle of school garden learning in the teaching and learning process is beneficial for sustainable learning outcomes.\n",
      "After the 1898 Philippine revolution, the English language was introduced in the country by the Americans and it began to surmount in the consciousness of the Filipino people. For one century now, this language has become dominant in the Filipino consciousness. Linguistically, it has even influenced the classification of the vocabulary of the Visayan-Cebuano language, i.e., according to the English eight parts of speech. But, as early as 1947, Manuel Yap, bishop and biblical scholar from Carcar, Cebu, objected, saying that the Visayan-Cebuano vocabulary does not fit in the English eight-parts-of-speech classification. This study, then, aims at inquiring into Yapâ€™s own classification of the Visayan-Cebuano vocabulary. In doing this, it uses the descriptive-analysis research design. First, it presents the English eight-parts-of-speech classification, and second, Yapâ€™s classification of the Visayan-Cebuano vocabulary. It concludes that Yapâ€™s classification is the one that fits to the nature of the Visayan-Cebuano vocabulary.\n",
      "The study is descriptive qualitative research that illustrates the circumstances and new dynamics contributing to the never-ending suicide occurrences. It described first-hand real-life experiences of the suicide-loss survivors to determine the contexts, reasons, and implications of suicide and recommend community-based intervention strategies. Purposive-criterion and convenient sampling methods were used to determine the respondents. Focused group discussion and in-depth interviews were conducted to gather data analyzed using Braun & Clarkeâ€™s six-phase guide. The findings revealed that the life experiences of the respondents are characterized by regret, pain, and bereavement. Suicides were committed due to dysfunctional families, economic hardships, breakdown of relationships, and drug abuse. The pain of suicide affected both the victim and their survivors and occurs within the psychosocial sphere. Interventions should therefore employ a familial, communitarian, and inter-institutional approach. Local Government Units (LGUs) are recommended to initiate a reach-out community-based suicide intervention program and debriefing services.\n",
      "The COVID-19 restrictions compelled institutions worldwide to transition into the remote teaching-learning modality abruptly. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of remote teaching and learning strategies are scant. With the recent shift to this new learning mode, little is known about the fulfillment of learning outcomes and student satisfaction. This research examines the impact of the teaching-learning course design and instructional strategies as implemented by this faculty researcher last school year 2020-2021. It intends to provide practical guidance for teachers aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of their remote teaching/strategies. The research is both quantitative (causal) and qualitative design. A total of 104 management students from a Philippine state university participated in an online survey. The quantitative investigation assessed the influence of the independent variables â€“ the Community of Inquiry (CoI) presence strategies, course design, and instructional strategies on studentsâ€™ perceived learning and satisfaction, utilizing the CoI framework and adopting scales from online teaching.\n",
      "The complexity of financial reporting highlights the need for professional skepticism among auditors. This study examined the relationship between auditors’ professional skepticism (PS) and thinking styles (TS) and explored what associations exist among PS, TS, and auditors’ sociodemographic attributes. Using snowball sampling, we surveyed 139 auditors in the Philippines using the Thinking Styles Inventory – Revised II and the Professional Skepticism Scale. Confirmatory analysis using Kendall’s tau-B showed a strong correlation between PS and TS I (creativity-generating style), implying that it plays a prominent role in professional skepticism. Contrary to earlier studies, our study found only a moderate correlation between TS II (norm-favoring style) and PS. The k-Modes clustering algorithm revealed that auditors showing high PS were low-ranking, less-experienced licensed female CPAs in firms with global affiliations and manifesting creative-generating TS. These findings add to the accounting profession’s understanding of PS and may be of valuable help in cultivating PS among auditors.\n",
      "Because of COVID-19, people have felt the social distance and have resorted to the internet for information needs. Hence, fake news has become prevalent as people rely on information explored online. This research aims to examine the social-cultural impacts of fake news adaptation behavior from the social psychological perspective by investigating the relationship between collectivism, social support, sense of belonging, social endorsement, fear of missing out, perceived credibility, issue involvement, and adaptation on fake news among young adults in Malaysia. A quantitative research approach with an online self-administered survey was conducted, and 451 responses were obtained through snowball sampling. In the data analysis, measurement and structural equation modeling were adopted. Findings showed that the relationships among adaptation behaviors on fake news were significantly supported. This research consummates the understanding of the influences of social-cultural (collectivism) on the judgment formation of adaptation among internet users on fake news.\n",

      "The COVID-19 lockdowns upended business operations, impacting microenterprises which prompted the Cebu Province to implement a stimulus grant to revive existing and encourage start-up microenterprises known as the Sugbo Negosyo program. A digital card system (DCS) with a quick response (QR) code payment was utilized to facilitate the disbursement of financial assistance and to enable real-time monitoring of the program beneficiaries’ expenditure transactions. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the DCS, investigating how the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and attitude towards its use have influenced the actual use and satisfaction of the DCS use by the beneficiaries. The research, a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods, was participated by 212 beneficiaries through face-to-face surveys. With the Technology Acceptance Method (TAM) as the study’s framework, the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) results show that the DCS is evaluated as useful and easy to use and satisfied the beneficiaries.\n",
      "To promote financial inclusivity while being responsive to technology demands, the Philippine government implemented a framework that requires banks to improve and innovate their payment systems. The introduction of the National Retail Payment System raises the question of whether the aim of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas in advancing digital financial inclusion significantly impacts the financial stability of universal and commercial banks. This correlational study examines the impact of digital financial inclusion on bank stability utilizing principal component analysis and linear regression analysis from a dataset of 19 universal and commercial banks from 2017 to 2019. Findings showed that a higher level of digital financial inclusion is associated with higher banking stability for Philippine universal and commercial banks. While the results support the study hypothesis of a positive relationship between the two (2) variables, the statistical significance cannot be guaranteed at the outset of this analysis due to the limited number of years examined.\n",
      "This research work centers on the culture of tuba, a fermented drink primarily composed of coconut sap and barok. This drink is commonly found in the province of Leyte, Philippines. Utilizing oral history coupled with related studies from reputable journals, this paper presents tuba as a beverage common and perfected in the province of Leyte, hence forms part Leyte's tangible culture. Further, this liquor, being a commodity, can be a source of income on the part of the mananggiti, the alpor, and anyone who wishes to sell it. This paper also narrates how tuba is valued as part of Leyte's culture, and tries to understand how tuba nurtures certain Filipino values. This paper concludes that this liquor is essential to the province's culture, hence, worthy to be documented and perpetuated by highlighting the need to elevate the value of the mananggiti.\n",
      "This study mirrors the symbolic actions of cultural characters in Davao folk narratives. It utilized descriptive-narrative and narrative-conversational methods to collect and analyze the folk narratives in the Davao region. The Cultural Symbolism theory of Clifford Geertz was used to reveal the interweaving culture of the indigenous people. Thus, the symbolic actions present in the texts are the following: pangayaw (tribal war), divine intervention, hunting, trading, belief in the existence of heaven, usage of magical instruments, cursing and casting enchantments, and patronizing a Datu. Hence, this study contributes to the preservation of culture which is slowly vanishing due to the effects of colonization, modernization, and globalization. Thus, further studies on myths, folktales, folk songs, folk speeches, and folk epics should be done to promote the cultural awareness among postmodern Filipinos.\n",
      "Starting with the assumption that media, particularly magazines, serve as a ground that shape the ideological landscape for women representations, this paper explored feminine ideologies and representations of twelve (12) Cosmopolitan Philippines magazine covers from the year 2015. Underlying ideological structures were found not only in the linguistic but symbolic features of the text as well.Â  Employing the methodologies of multimodal critical discourse analysis, the investigation revealed emerging patterns on how women are portrayed and represented in the magazine covers.Â  The â€œfun and fearlessâ€ catchphrase that the magazine has shaped to define the modern Filipina (a) presents them as hypersexualized and practicing adventurous sex, (b) positions them as followers of health and beauty regimens and glamorous lifestyle that ultimately lead to the affirmation of the opposite sex, and (c) objectifies them through come-hither poses and scantily-clad bodies that emphasize the cleavage, toned abdomens, and legs.Â  The paper also discussed the possible implications brought about by the perpetuation of these ideological structures.\n",
      "Catholic education is closely linked to the evangelical mission of the Church. As such, the primary intent of Catholic education is to proclaim the message of salvation to all people. Accordingly, Catholic education aims to provide an integral formation with a religious dimension that will equip the human person to become life, work, and mission ready and attain salvation. But given the contemporary socio-economic, cultural, political, and technological milieus characterized by a secular and consumerist view and praxis, the value of Catholic education may have been obscured or affected.Â  Thus, this paper aims to investigate and analyze the views and practices of the faculty of a Catholic University about Catholic education. The purposive sampling method was used to determine the participants in the study. Using a qualitative research design, the data were gathered from the participants using the face-to-face interview method. Aided by the phenomenological method, the findings discovered semblance in the participants' views and practices of Catholic education with that of Catholic Church. Despite the observed undesirable elements that obscure and marginalize it, Catholic education faithfully remains a Catholic. But making religion as the core of the curriculum of Catholic education is still a great challenge for Catholic schools to realize. Thus, the collaboration of all stakeholders is vital to address this perennial challenge in Catholic education.\n",
      "This study aims to identify whether the Senior High School students are Linguistic, Discourse, Sociolinguistic or Strategic Competent in English. Quantitative and qualitative research methods were used to collate a survey that would sure mend the study. With comprehensive computation of the random datasets, almost every Senior High School student achieved a satisfactory rating in both the Perceptions and Abilities Categories. A Chi-Square Statistic was also used and yielded maximum values which consequently, resulted to low p-values, suggesting the negation of the studyâ€™s null hypothesis. The result is further supported using the correlation statistic which corresponds to a high correlation between the studentsâ€™ Perceptions and Abilities in their speaking competence. The outcome of the summary of all competencies show that the Linguistic Competence contributed the most to the overall language intents of the students with sociolinguistic competence giving the least, which results in Linguistic Competence being the widely used language competency and sociolinguistic as not often practiced language skill amongst the students. With this, the Senior High School students are far more competent in phonetics, pronunciation, Phonology, Morphology, Syntax and Semantics rather than on the socio-cultural languages such as vocabulary, politeness and language style.\n",

      "With the advancing technology, online shopping is pacing fast. This calls for looking into factors that influence a consumerâ€™s decision to buy online. With this, the present study investigated four variables namely consumer innovativeness, perceived benefit, perceived risk, and brand image and its impact toward consumerâ€™s decision to buy online. To address this aim, four hundred eighty (480) participants were recruited online and randomly assigned into one of the sixteen treatment conditions with the presence and/or absence of the four variables being investigated. Results of two-way analysis of variance showed that, in an online selling platform, the presence of consumer innovativeness and perceived benefit, the presence of perceived benefit and perceived risk, and brand image had significant influence in oneâ€™s decision to buy online. Findings provide implications towards improving an online websiteâ€™s shopping platform which may motivate the consumer to buy.\n",

      "This paper presents an optimal dispatch of battery storage and its economic viability with a photovoltaic system. There are four modelled scenarios based on the combination of interruptible load program and the time-of-use scheme. The scenarios were modelled using a Binary Particle Swarm Optimization and were simulated using Matlab v6. In all the scenarios, this model successfully optimizes the battery dispatch scheduling while simultaneously minimizes the DUâ€™s penalty from exceeding the maximum allowable power demand. This algorithm also optimizes the linearly forecasted demand for the next six year for all the scenarios. Then, an economic analysis for the possible investment to the combined BESS and PV system is conducted through the comparison of the payback periods of each scenario. The first scenario is implemented without ILP and a ToU scheme and has 79.86 payback years. With ILP scheme only, the second scenario has 33.37 payback years. Then the third scenario with ToU scheme only has a 30.29 payback years. Finally, the fourth scenario, with both ILP and ToU schemes, shows the fastest recovery of the investment with 21.57 payback years. Thus the combination of both ILP and ToU schemes provide the best economic benefit. Though the current proposed system is still not economically feasible however the foreseen positive trends on solar and battery technologies will make this system viable.\n",
      "The different features of entomophagy and entomotherapy practiced by the key informants and local villagers in Cebu Island, Philippines were documented.A survey was conducted in remote areas of Barangay Alambijud, Argao and BarangayLusaran, Cebu City, Cebu from June-October,2012 to discover the medicinal and edible uses of different insect species in these sites. Fourteen key informants were identified with the aid of two sampling methods- snowball technique and purposive sampling. Open-ended questionnaires were employed to obtain authentic and significant information from the key informants. An inventory on the knowledge on the wild edible and medicinal insects in the study areas is presented here. Results showedthat these key informants profusely utilized wide range of biological resources in diverse ways, and thus contribute to their daily activities. As a whole, the factors that influenced their entomological practices include their socio-demographic and educational background, accessibility to urban societies and the open availability of certain resources particularly the insects they use and the influence brought about by their family and community. Moreover, these informants had different insects used in their practices, and they had their ways of preparing and administering these as medicines and food. Regardless of these differences, all of them were able to perceive that the insects used as medicine and food were equally beneficial to them.Traditional knowledge regardingentomotherapy and entomophagy in Cebu is very essential since folk medicine is still one of the most important resources for food and discovery of unknown natural drug resources. It is indicated that these medicinal and edible insects are comparable with other conventional food commodities by incorporating scientific validation to the traditional knowledge.\n",

      "As international criticism of the Philippine governmentâ€™s war on drugs continues, this study aims to find out the rate of drug trafficking incidences of various countries in the world and explore how this is affected by the respective countriesâ€™ legal and socio-economic conditions, specifically: (1) Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per country, (2) public sectorâ€™s perceived corruption index, and (3) countryâ€™s legal standing on prohibited drugs. This study utilizes data mining or exploratory method. Data on the various variables were gathered from statistical reports from various reputable world agencies and subjected to statistical analysis in order to determine their significance in relation to drug trafficking.Â Of the three dimensions analyzed in this study, only economic and social factors show relationship to drug trafficking. Rich countries have less corruption; thus, they have better law-enforcement. As a result, they register more drug trafficking apprehensions. Corrupt countries however, have lower apprehensions; thus, registering a lower drug trafficking rate. Poor countries register higher corruption index and lesser apprehensions of illegal drugs. To fight drug trafficking, it is important to eradicate corruption in order to gain ground in the fight against drugs.The lone dimension that shows no relationship is the political dimension such as restrictive and non-restrictive government policies on drugs. This is corroborated by other studies that indicated a War on Drugs to be ineffective as compared to drug treatment.\n",
      "The importance of studentâ€™s evaluation for promotion leads teachers to be lenient in exchange of a good evaluation result.Â  This study looks into the possible effects of midterm grades to the evaluation results of teachers at the end of the semester.Â  The study utilized data mining approach using midterm grades and evaluation results of full-time and part-time faculty members.Â  Both parametric and non-parametric analyses were employed in the study. Findings revealed a weak correlation between the midterm grades of students and their evaluation rating of teachers.Â  Looking at grading leniency versus teacher status, it was found out that grades of full-time faculty was significantly higher compared to part time and grades of tenured faculty was significantly higher compared to their probationary counterpart.Â  Therefore, administrators in higher education institution, who uses studentâ€™s evaluation result as a key indicator of instructorâ€™s effectiveness, should be very careful as these results might not represent the true performance of a teacher inside the classroom.\n",

      "Manâ€™s basic attitude towards reality determines his end.Â  Man either opts to accept reality and becomes an optimist or denies and becomes a pessimist.Â  The study presented the reality of human experience.Â  And these experiences of human reality all boil into the experience of oneâ€™s self and become a test of subjectivity.Â  In the history of philosophy of Man, this outlook into the experience of the self develops into three stages: first, dualism propagated by the Greeks and Aristotle turned into second, monism which extremely focused on one aspect of human reality in relation to man, then, turned into pluralism which views various aspects of man in relation to the kind of society that becomes the by-product of such development and yet makes the identity of man more complicated.Â  In the history of philosophy, human consciousness was so caught up in dualism between body and spirit-mind that became an issue for philosophers like the Greek such as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle and followers such as Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes and others until it split into extreme monism of either materialism or intellectualism-spiritualism developed into more complex pluralism that resulted to a pluralist society.Â  Hence, there is a call for unity especially for existential-phenomenologist in order to gather and link every piece of event and experience into a complete history of human reality as well as to form this experiential event called humanity.\n",
      "Recognizing the human dimension on participation to environmental conservation initiatives, this study determined the socio-economic characteristics of stakeholders in Bataan Coastal Resource Management (CRM) and how these variables influence their participation in the process. Data were collected through a survey. Four variables revealed to be independent indicators of high or poor CRM participation: the stakeholdersâ€™ locality income class, age, level of education, and household size. These indicators are important matters to cogitate for they are indirect drivers of the success or failure of CRM activities. It is concluded that Bataan CRM in the Philippines needs to be reviewed to tackle socio-economic barriers to engagement. Assessment of the process of selecting Bataan CRM participants; strengthened information, education, and communication component through an enriched content and rationalized delivery; institution of a unified CRM database system; and establishment of a provincial CRM research center are all recommended to counteract stakeholder estrangement and unresponsiveness to CRM efforts.\n",
      "Energy conservation is a buzzword that cuts across a broad spectrum of stakeholders. It has been widely practiced, developed, and discussed in government, political, and industrial sectors due to its massive impact on tackling issues related to climate change and global warming as well as presenting opportunities to cut energy costs. Despite the active discussion of this topic in the literature, very few papers have discussed it in the context of academic institutions which has one of the most significant impacts in terms of energy consumption. To address the issue, this paper places the topic of energy conservation in the context of academic institutions. Moreover, it adopts the Theory of Planned Behavior to investigate the success of energy conservation initiatives in academic institutions by looking at user behavior and its antecedents. Finally, this paper contributes significantly to the literature as it is one of the very few papers and arguably the first to discuss energy conservation in the context of academic institutions using the Theory of Planned Behavior. Furthermore, this paper will be beneficial for practitioners and other stakeholders in that it provides them with a framework to investigate the success of implementing energy conservation initiatives, especially, in academic institutions by looking at the antecedents of user behavior.\n",
      "In this paper, I aim to show that the critical appropriation of political power can be a potential tool in transforming political structures into just institutions. To achieve this aim, I employ Ricoeurâ€™s hermeneutics of symbols because in his different political essays, he consistently regards political power as akin to a symbol. Thus, for him, the critical appropriation of political power requires a hermeneutical procedure. And so in my discussion, I devote one section for Ricoeurâ€™s hermeneutics of symbols, one for his thoughts on political power, and another one for the critical appropriation of political power through the hermeneutics of symbols. To put Ricoeurâ€™s political and hermeneutical thoughts in a better light, I introduce these sections with a separate section on his philosophical anthropology. In my conclusion, I affirm that transforming political structures into just institutions is very much possible through the critical appropriation of political power. It is such a potential tool in effecting these transformations because the critical appropriation of political power involves a hermeneutical procedure that follows a three-step process of reflection. And reflection, which makes way for the critical appropriation of political power, is what ensures that power rests only in the hands of those who are more likely to advance the common good, resulting into a greater possibility for the transformation of political structures into just institutions.\n",
      "This study developed a geographic information system (GIS)-based decision support system in the spatial identification of a viable location for shallow tube-well irrigation development in the province of Isabela. Factors such as slope, soil type; land cover and groundwater depth were used as input parameters. Around 98% of the existing shallow tube-wells were within the suitable area. The developed map was validated using existing irrigated areas. Results show that more than 377,000 hectares were found potentially suitable locations for shallow tube-well irrigation development. These areas are characterized with a water table depth of <6.5 m, a slope of<18%, soil textures (sandy loam, clay loam, and sandy clay). Sufficient factors in combination with the GIS tool is a great tool to carry out spatial data in land-use analysis and the use of this as a means in identifying viable locations for shallow tube-well irrigation development in other places is reliable.\n",
      "The highly irregular and rough fluctuations of the twin primes below or equal to a positive integer x     are considered in this study. The occurrence of a twin prime on an interval [0,x] is assumed to be random. In particular, we considered the waiting time between arrivals of twin primes as approximated by a geometric distribution which possesses the discrete memory-less property. For large n, the geometric distribution is well-approximated by the exponential distribution. The number of twin primes less or equal to x will then follow the Poisson distribution with the same rate parameter as the exponential distribution. The results are compared with the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture on the frequency of twin primes. We successfully demonstrated that for large n, the proposed model is superior to the H-L conjecture in predicting the frequency of twin primes.\n",

Data on the number of countries with confirmed reports of dengue (Messina et al. 2014) and surface temperature difference (General Circulation Model) were subjected to scatter plots and linear regression. There were 113 recorded countries across three regions (America=44, comprising the North and South; Africa=28; and Asia=41) reporting dengue incidence from 1943 to 2013, of which 98 countries (America=41; Africa=20; and Asia=37 with the inclusion of Australia) reported confirmed dengue cases caused by DENV-1. Findings suggest that the effect of temperature to the expansion of dengue varies dramatically in certain groups of country. Here, we explore three patterns (PAT) of expansion response where 1) continuous increase in temperature results into a continuous increase in the number of countries with dengue cases (PAT-A), 2) initial increase in temperature results into increase in the number of countries with dengue cases but subsequent increase in temperature results in the decline of dengue expansion (PAT-B), and 3) initial increase in temperature results into higher rate of dengue expansion but continued increase slows it down (PAT-C). PAT-A represented the majority of these countries, including 10 out of 11 countries in Southeast Asia. These results are in congruence with the past studies that supports dengue expansion to be temperature-dependent.\n",
      "Efficiency of beekeeping industry depends not only on honeybee strains, its management and hive structures, but also on the abundance, availability and proper utilization of bee flora around bee farming areas. The present investigation was conducted in three barangays in Northwestern Cagayan covering Culao, Sitio Nagbaranganan in Centro 2 and Balingit from March 2014 to April 2015. Â The study used a descriptive survey method to identify the diversity of melliferous resources and to develop a floral calendar in relation to pollen and nectar availability in the area. Data was analyzed using a frequency count. Â In the three vegetations sampled, 54 plant species are useful to honeybees, 27 of which are forest trees, 25 are agricultural crops, and one each is a shrub and a weed. The study ascertained 18 flowering plants as extremely important bee floras since these blossom throughout the year. March to May were identified as the honey flow periods.Â  July to September (dry season) and October to December (rainy season) were the dearth periods for honeybees in the study area. A floral calendar was developed based on the characteristics, abundance, time and duration of bloom of the bee flora. Â Northwestern Cagayan is suitable to initiate bee farming.\n",

      "Renewable energy sources are foreseen to rise as they become scarce and expensive fossil fuels. Considering this thought, each country implements different strategies and national policies to support the development of renewable sources. However, these emerging developments may contribute to its depletion of natural sources. In this paper, an exploratory pattern analysis was used on 125 selected countries to determine the underlying trends on the effect of the development of renewable energy (RE) sources while utilizing the countriesâ€™ natural resources. Due to different status of each country, the trends were grouped in similar associations such as negative, positive and bell-like relationships. Developed countries showed a negative relationship where the natural resources are heavily utilized in the early stages but rapidly decreased as the RE progresses. This reflects the capability of these countries with high to very-high human development index (HDI) to invest more on advanced technologies which utilize fewer natural resources. On the other hand, the underdeveloped countries with low to moderate HDI behave in a positive relationship showing their heavily dependence on its natural resources as RE progresses. Moreover, a group of developing countries between developed and underdeveloped categories and without direct relationship to HDI showed a transition between positive to negative transition as the RE progresses.\n",

      "Using a camera for measurement reading is simplified through the incorporation of computer vision application. The variations in the environmentâ€™s setting, however, may constitute to the occurrence of measurement errors. A study investigated the significant effect of changing the camera-to-lens displacements and the variations of the illumination level on the short-distance measurement reading. This is performed initially by developing an actual setup calibrated though the comparison with the hypothesized values. Then, an experiment on this calibrated setup generates the measurement results of varying the displacement positions and the illumination levels. Through descriptive and comparative statistical analysis, there is evidence that the variations of the displacement alone do not significantly change the measurement results. Similarly, the variations in the illumination levels do not also constitute significant changes on the measurement results. Hence, each of the variables bears no contribution on the occurrence of the measurement error of using camera. It is further confirmed through the two way analysis of variance that there is no significant difference on the displacement positions and illumination levels, and on their interactions. These results verified that a camera can be used as a short-distance measurement tool adequately regardless on the object-to-lens displacement positions and on the illumination levels.\n",
      "This study is a validation of the varied parameters of global competitiveness level of the ASEAN countries. Government effectiveness (GE) and corruption control (CC) are the direct predictors and independent variables while global competitiveness (GC) is the response variable. The determined causal factors affected by government effectiveness and corruption control are human development (HD) and enabling trade facilitation (ETF) which have varied impacts to global competitiveness. The researcher utilized a path analysis where 6 path models were established from the predictors (x) to its response variable (y) to determine which among these factors creates a huge impact. Path coefficients were generated and the summation of value effects was determined. Findings revealed that government effectiveness and corruption control were substantial elements that influenced the dynamism and vitality of global competitiveness landscape. However, GE has a strong direct effect to GC as compared to CC and from amongst the indirect effects, the correlation between GE and HD relative to GC has the highest path coefficient. The existing economic and political conditions of the individual ASEAN member countries reflected by the implications of the raw data collected are seen as an impediment to a more collective performance. Hence, this study implies a two-fold re-evaluation and strengthening of the policy formulation and implementation individually and collectively as a regional bloc.\n",
      "The study is a reflection on the phenomenological hermeneutics of Paul Ricoeur which is based on the selected issues entangling the mystery of hermeneutics in relation to identity.Â  It delves into hermeneutics -- its kind, characteristics, and various relevant topics such as the role of philosophy, theology, biblical/sacred writing, history, culture, media, relation between the text-author and the reader-interpreter, human identity and character, love and justice, ethics and morality, law and command and the like. In a comprehensive manner, it also analyzes the phenomenological hermeneutics of Ricoeur exploring into the interpretation on the mystery of hermeneutics on the self and identity i.e. the human person who is created into the â€œimage of Godâ€ capable of giving love, justice and embracing the fullness of hermeneutics of the self that was perfected in the â€œimage of Christ.â€ The human person is the entire project that journeys toward meaningful existence concretized by manâ€™s search for ultimate happiness.

      "This paper argues that contrary to some critics, Augustine, the philosopher and pillar of the Catholic faith, did tackle resurrection [of the flesh or body] by examining some of his writings. The author traces the development of Augustineâ€™s interpretation of the resurrection of the body by examining the context and some texts in four of his works, namely, De fide et symbolo, Opus imperfectum contra Julianum, De Catechizandis Rudibus, and the Enchiridion . The researcher investigates further on: (a) Augustineâ€™s understanding of the â€œresurrection of the fleshâ€ in the Creed, (b) the developmental understanding of â€œresurrection of the fleshâ€ from the different representative texts enumerated above, and (c) the theological conclusion that one could infer from the investigation whether or not it is in consonance with the present understanding of Augustine and the present formulation as theologically accepted in the present time.\n",
      "This study determined the indicators for an improved faculty accomplishment based on selected profile (age, the number of years of teaching, performance rating, and salary), Common Criteria for Evaluation or CCE (educational qualification, professional achievements, and academic experience) and Qualitative Contribution Evaluation (QCE) ratings. One hundred percent (160) of faculty with ratings in the NBC- 461 6th cycle comprised the respondent which was evidently adequate as sample based on Kaiserâ€“Meyerâ€“Olkin (KMO) results. The Bartlettâ€™s test of sphericity indicates that variables are well-defined for Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The pre-defined indicators were categorized as indexes labeled as Input-Process-Output-Outcome. Results show that change in the Outcome of HE varies depending on the variables involved in the analysis. Considering full data, data with QCE and data of senior faculty, Inputs, Processes, and Outputs significantly contribute towards an improved (Outcome) faculty accomplishment (FA). The analysis on junior faculty (JF), showed that only Inputs and Outputs were significantly affecting change on Outcome of HE. Moreover, the most significantly affecting indicators towards faculty accomplishments are performance rating, age, and number of years of teaching. Then educational qualification followed, next are professional achievement and academic experience, and lastly the QCE.\n",
      "This study aimed to explore poverty among ASEAN member nations by introducing a multidimensional poverty index that can be used to determine the relative success of a country in deterring several deprivations that are identified and measured. It utilized multiple factors that can be useful for policy and investment decisions and are intended to complement analyses using financial poverty indicators. Using exploratory data analysis, several indicators were selected to represent the different dimensions of poverty. Said indicators were then subjected to factor analysis which yielded four multidimensional indices namely: General Welfare Index, Governance and Emotional Landscape Index, and Social Climate Index. Singapore, Brunei, and Malaysia ranked 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in all three indices, respectively. In addition, multivariate cluster analysis was also performed. It revealed that Singapore exhibited exceptional performance in all indices, thereby earning it a cluster all to its own. Similarities were observed between Brunei and Malaysia while Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, and Indonesia were clustered together. Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar belonged to another cluster, indicating similarities among them. The study concluded that a wide gap exists among ASEAN countries in terms of the various deprivations measured. It also identified several problem areas and strengths of the ASEAN member states. This information can be helpful in making sound judgments especially in the delicate circumstances that surround economic integration.\n",
      "This paper recognizes the presence of sovereign debt as primary means of financing its expenditures. It practically covers the gaps between cash outflows and inflows from a countryâ€™s revenues such as those coming from taxes. However, when a countryâ€™s debt goes too high that it already has difficulty in paying it off, sovereign bankruptcy occurs. This study dwells at the factors that lead to sovereign bankruptcy among ASEAN countries in terms of business confidence, credit management, resource availability and market stability. To measure the indicators in determining the nations in the verge of being bankrupt, the researchers use the data depicting the corruption perception index, GDP and investment climate index. Furthermore, data regarding the ease of doing business rankings, credit ratings, surplus/deficit of the government budget, external debt, current account balance and inflation rate are also considered. These indicators are believed to be suggestive of a countryâ€™s capability of sustaining its overall debt, highlighting the point that an ASEAN country should take into account all its resources to ensure that it doesnâ€™t go bankrupt as a nation especially now that it is looking into integrating itself into one economic ASEAN community.\n",
      "This study is an empirical validation of the economic and environmental parameters of tourism in the Philippines. The determined tourism factors to be affected by tropical depressions are: tourist arrivals, tourism employment rate and travel price. These factors had varied impacts on economic growth in terms of annual gross domestic product through: exchange rate, inflation rate, consumer price index, and employment rate. The researcher utilized a path analysis to determine which among the tourism factors had a robust effect by the tropical depression. This study also concludes the effects (both direct and indirect) of predictors to GDP. A model was established from the predictors (x) to its response (y). To demonstrate the paths from the origin to the end, a computed path coefficients were generated. The summation of value effects was determined and an effect model was established. Findings revealed that travel price factor was a prevalent element that influenced the volatility of GDP and not more on the tourist arrivals and tourism employment rate. Tourists, regardless of nationality, prefer to spend more their money, enjoy and mesmerize the natural beauty of Philippines even with the occurrence of natural disturbances. Hence, this study implies on strengthening the policy of fixed prices on travels and all in-country cost, developing more the outdoor and indoor tourism industry, the Philippines infrastructure to sustain and enhance tourism services.\n",
      "Indonesia, being the world leader in the production of crude palm oil, has been successful in serving the domestic and world market with palm products and palm derivatives. The industry contributes US$17.6 billion through exports in 2012. At present, the demand for crude palm oil has soared high due to the increasing awareness of the varied uses of palm oil. The challenge to countries cultivating oil palm is how to cope with the local and global demand .The focus now is to increase plantation areas to produce a higher volume of crude oil to serve the needs of the world market. Today, the total land area planted to oil palm in Indonesia has reached 9.7 million hectares. This study used data mining and Delphi technique.

      "The higher education market portends to be a huge market in the future that traditional systems of delivery of services will be insufficient. This paper proposes a model that links two (2) global markets: the higher education market and the labor market, as dramatic changes are taking place in the 21st century. A modeling and simulation strategy has been employed in this paper predicting the impact of higher education market to the labor market. Results indicated that with the rapid expansion of the Higher Education(HE) market, the size of the higher education labor force will inevitably expand.The labor market tolerates a maximum expansion capacity for HE graduates beyond which the excess HE graduates will bifurcate into two (2) channels of productive sector, namely: (a) the creation of new economies or (b) the integration of HE graduates into the skilled labor force. This dynamics necessarily yields a highly fragmented labor force configuration. In essence, the evolution of the labor market is a replica of Darwinâ€™s Biological Theory of Evolution where only the fittest will survive, i.e. evolution through mutation and adaptation whose equivalent concepts in this setting are â€œinnovationâ€ and â€œadaptationâ€ respectively. It is well-established in Evolutionary Biology that â€œmutationâ€ is the shortest-route to evolution and so we posit that â€œinnovationâ€ is the shortest route to the labor market evolutionary ladder.Therefore, a good university must be able to produce graduates who are innovative and adaptive at the same time to survive in a competitive labor market.\n",

      "The contrasting practices of private and public institutions affect individuals motivation to work on the maintenance of its facilities. This paper attempts to develop a model that could predict how many years a facility (private or government) would last based on the given number of assumptions and random data. The study used an experimental design using simulation modeling. Assumptions were formulated to measure different variables. Findings revealed that government facilities tend to deteriorate faster compared to its private counterparts. Government facilities would only last approximately up to six (6) years then reach its critical level. This is due to the assumption that only 40% of government institutions are effective workers. Low percentage of effective workers would translate to less motivation of the worker to pursue any transaction that could possibly help the current state of the facility. On the other hand, more than half of the Private facilities would last more than five years before reaching a critical level. This is due to the assumption that private workers are 20% higher compared to government workers in terms of percentage of effective workers. A highly motivated worker will always be willing to spend time, even extra time, to perform his job. Benign neglect of a less motivated workforce would result to non performance of his assigned task. Therefore, increasing the level of motivation of an employee is the primordial concern of every organization whether private or public because an increase of well motivated and effective workforce would encourage everyone to help maintain and to extend the life of every facility.\n",

      "The Asian economy has been continuously growing since the beginning of the 21st century. Asian countries are starting to carve their names in the A-list of the growing world economy. Considering the stability of its excellent performance in a continual growth, the researchers endeavored to find out whether what a countryâ€™s economic growth is reflected in the level of satisfaction of its citizens.Using exploratory data analysis, indices pertinent relating to general perception, social trust, security, government performance, and professional relations were calculated. Results showed that countries which are generally perceived to be not doing well in terms of economy seem to exhibit a higher level of satisfaction from its citizens.\n",
      "Random walk has been held as a sufficient condition for describing the stock market as efficient, which implies that investors cannot predict the market returns or equivalently, abnormal profits cannot be obtained just by knowing the past prices. This study tests the random walk hypothesis in the case of Philippine Stock Prices, using the daily PSE index (PSEi) covering the period 03 January 2005-16 February 2016. Main results, employing the informal or visual methods such as plot analysis of log returns and correlogram, suggest some initial evidence of non-randomness. The formal methods, employing tests for unit root, runs, sequences and reversals, variance ratio, and autocorrelations, show that the PSEi prices do not follow a random walk behavior.\n",
      "The study explored on the ethical dilemmas of human resource managers and uncovered the process by which the managers resolve the dilemmas. This study used a grounded theory approach to formulate a basic social process model (theoretical model) of resolving those moral conflicts. All informants are human resource managers from private higher education institutions. The study followed the Glasserian grounded theory analysis to formulate a resolution process theory using the data gathered from the beginning. With the use of grounded theory analysis, it was found out that the six main processes used by the informants were (1) Consistency with policies; (2) Character check; (3) Considering consequences; (4) Communication; (5) Cultural sensitivity; and (6) Counteractive mechanism.\n",
      "This study investigated the positioning of teacher education institutions (TEIs) in the glocalization continuum of bilingual complexities in responding to the global and local demands for harmonious and peaceful nation building. This study was exploratory in nature. The researchers used survey questionnaires to account the effects of more than four decades of enforcement of Bilingual Education in the Microcosm area in Cebu City (Philippines).Stratified sampling technique was employed; wherein strata were divided based on specialization of the 213 pre-service teachers. Cronbachâ€™sÂ alpha was usedto measure reliability and internal consistency of the instrument. Principle component method through factor analysis was utilized to reduce the data complexity and to identify important factors of bilingual education policy. Results revealed that bilingual education policy has duplicitous character in a non-native English country. Yet, it is a tool that can propel nation building. Much of it lies in the hands of the teacher education institutionsâ€™ power and capacity to ignite other industries of the country.\n",
      "The ASEAN from its original purpose of conception has evolved into what it is envisioned now of integrating the 10 individual economies into a single regional economy. Its traditional practice of consensus and consultation poses a challenge and as a factor in lagging behind the development of its implementation. But what state from among the ten members is the best candidate to lead the organization remained to be a question. This research explores the possibility of determining the potential leader of the organization by considering several variables like corruption perception index, global competitiveness, government effectiveness, GNI, etc. and utilized the process known as exploratory data analysis or data mining in gathering data. Data gathered were then processed through the use of statistical software to cluster the variables. Cluster analysis was then performed to establish relevant relationships, similarities, or differences of the data collected. Results and data gathered from several relevant studies about the topic were also collectively analyzed to determine the gap of perspectives from other notable scholars and to gain new insights to fill in that gap. Based on this method of analysis, it was revealed that thereâ€™s a single country that stands out from the rest and is the best candidate to lead the ASEAN Integration. A new paradigm shift is beginning to surface from collective to a single leadership.\n",
      "The concepts of morality and religiosity have been associated with each other in a manner that these two co-exist and they are of equal importance for a human personâ€™s eventual ideal character. Accordingly, moral philosophy teaches that a personâ€™s moral foundation can be linked to his spiritual foundation and vice versa as one of religionsâ€™ thrusts is construct the moral fibers necessary for manâ€™s ethical existence. A human personâ€™s spirituality and morality are substantial parts of his nature that he has to learn, nourish and value them so that he may develop into an ideal human person that he is suppose to be. He does not only have to indoctrinate and inculcate one of which and despise the other. This paper generally talks about the notions of Morality and Religiosity. Further, it also discusses on the interrelation of the two as the human person applies the same to actual convictions in life. Finally, a category is presented on what a person should ideally be as the two concepts are intertwined. This paper utilized the expository-descriptive type of research. Books, articles and other similar write-ups from the library, internet and other sources coupled with observations in the experiential world were the primary references. Such method was facilitative in the full realization of this research paper.\n",
      "Pediculosis capitis infestation, commonly known as head lice, a worldwide public health concern affecting individuals of all age groups, and prevalence in the general population can be as high as 40 percent. The main task attained in the study was the determination of the pediculicidal effects of Annona squamosa seed extract of different concentrations. Methodology utilized a true experimental design done in 3 trials; 10 live head lice were observed under each concentration of 25%, 50%, 75% atis seeds extract for the experimentation and 75% permethrin concentration as controlled group. In vitro testing was used and the subjects were placed in prepared petri dishes for experimentation. Data results found out that there is p-value of 0.067 at Î± = 0.05 for mean time elapsed (secs) for 100% head lice mortality. Significant p-level of 0.002 for pediculicidal activity for the first 5 minutes has been noted. The researchers derived up with a conclusion that Custard Apple (Annona squamosa) seed extract in 75%, 50% and 25% concentration is as effective as Commercial Pediculicide (Permethrin) in killing pediculosis Capitis. 50% concentration has comparable results to Permethrin and is the most effective due to its earlier onset of pediculicidal activity.\n",

      "Health expenditure of a country is intended to finance medicines and other medical services and assistance for those people affected with diseases especially those communicable ones. The global issue of tuberculosis has been a well-known communicable disease which could result in another type of such disease, if untreated. This study is conducted to assess the treatment success of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases, which had been a burden for countries in terms of financial aspects. Through the use of multivariate cluster and principal component analyses, ASEAN countries were grouped and ranked from very highly successful to least successful in the level of treatment success which would provide comprehensive findings as to what ASEAN country successfully provides financial to their diagnosed patients. Further, it was found out that the level of success of MDR-TB treatments among ASEAN countries varies inversely with the number of patients undergoing the treatment while directly proportional to the amount of investments in health expenditures. Hence, MDR-TB treatment success depends on the level of amount of investments for health the ASEAN country has and the number of patients undergoing the treatment. Thus, the success of the treatment can be achieved at high economic price.\n",
      "This study aimed to determine the predictors of subjective wellbeing among elderly. The researcher utilized a descriptive correlational design to identify patterns of relationship that existed between the variables and to measure the strength of the relationship, which in this case involved the individual variables (educational attainment, health status, employment status, and presence of stressors), family variables (marital status, family size, family income, quality of family relationship, and family support) and social characteristics (social relationships, church attendance, access to amenities/ transportation, safe environment and community participation) and the level of subjective wellbeing among the elderly. The study was conducted in the municipality of Sagbayan, Bohol, Philippines. The researcher utilized a self-made questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Scale, Spiritual Wellbeing Scale and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) to gather the needed information relevant to the variables under study. Multiple regression and analysis of variance through the SPSS software were utilized in the treatment and analysis of the data. It was found out that the mean level of subjective wellbeing among elderly falls under the average level of life satisfaction which means that the elderlies are generally satisfied with the different aspects of their lives but there are certain domains that they would very much like to improve. The study also revealed that the significant predictive variables for the elderliesâ€™ subjective wellbeing include age, health status, perceived stress, community participation, family income, and neighborhood safety. Implications of these results are noted for the development of programs and initiatives to enhance subjective wellbeing.\n",
      "The Philippines has been inundated with socio-politico issues that impede peopleâ€™s desire for the countryâ€™s uninterrupted progress. These issues may be complex but their antidote is contrarily simple. An answer is found in Immanuel Kantâ€™s thought on moral culture which pertains to three essential features, namely: obedience, truthfulness, and sociableness. This qualitative research focuses on the fundamental ideas in the section on moral culture in Kantâ€™s On Education. As my contribution to the fund of knowledge, I proceed by establishing the implications and antitheses of the three features of Kantâ€™s moral culture. A discussion on obedience differentiates its two kinds: absolute and voluntary. Absolute obedience is the result of compulsion by a command, while voluntary obedience is the result of confidence by a reasonable will. It is impossible to think of character formation without also thinking of truthfulness. Kant asserts that a man who tells lies has no character. Sociableness emphasizes on the importance of building relationships and friendships. The researcher contends that these three features of moral culture have corresponding antitheses: violation of laws of the land for obedience; lying and dishonesty (highest form is corruption in politics) for truthfulness; and human rights violation (highest form is war) for sociableness. Finally, these features are imperative in forging peace and social order which usher to a kind of development that people aspire.\n",
      "This study investigates the effectiveness of the Mother-Tongue Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE) Certificate Program to the academic performance of pupils utilizing their first language in learning. Teacher-scholarsâ€™ performance were measured in terms of teaching-learning and teaching facilitation. Moreover, pupilsâ€™ satisfaction level were determined based on the comparison of teachersâ€™ performance as scholars, trained and non-trained. The findings of this study revealed that teacher-scholars who enrolled in the certificate program showed positive and direct effect to pupilsâ€™ academic performance. An increase of pupilsâ€™ achievement and satisfaction level towards learning using MTB-MLE as a medium of instruction was grounded on the intensity of teachersâ€™ training about the implementation of MTB-MLE in each grade level. Furthermore, scrutinizing the differences of both teachersâ€™ performance and pupilsâ€™ performance in Grades 1-3 will be helpful in determining more provisions to make the K to 12 implementation more effective and more understandable to individuals within the cycle of learning.\n",
      "Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which can be spread by peopleâ€™s lifestyle, causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Social lifestyles such as multiple sexual partnerships, commitment, protected sex practices, and health checkups are lifestyle factors that can impact on the rate at which entry into any of the epidemiologic compartments S, I or D (death) slows or accelerates. Functional relationships between these social parameters and the disease parameters determined the model developed in this study and used predictive agent-based model to simulate the level of spread of HIV cases in Cebu with base data of the risky lifestyle of BPO agents in the region that could make them vulnerable to infections. Simulation results revealed that there is a rise on the incidence of HIV infections every year, which could become an epidemic in the future if no immediate intervention will be done. Â This high incidence of HIV cases in Cebu as evidenced by simulation results reflect the lack of awareness, prompt action, and policy in Cebu City with regards to mitigating the spread of the virus. Sans any intervention, the incidence of HIV infection can accelerate further in the future.\n",
      "To address low productivity and increase income, studies were conducted to improve the integrated crop management (ICM) of mungbean. Field experiments established using extracts, biocon agents, and varieties under various cropping systems. In rice-mungbean cropping system, Pagasa 19 applied with Vermitea and Carrageenan exhibited lowest CLS and rust infections. Carrageenan-treated plants produced yield, 0.77t/ha vs Control 0.41t/ha. Under corn-mungbean cropping system, Carrageenan-treated Pagasa 19 had the highest yield of 1.36t/ha. In other trials, CLS infection of Carrageenan-treated Pagasa 19 was reduced by 25.6% and the yield/ha was 62.3% higher than untreated valued at Php 29, 400.00/ha. In Pagasa 7, Carrageenan is effective against CLS and rust, and gave the highest yield of 1.37 ton/ha. The Kulabo, whether applied with Carrageenan, Boron or NPV, reduced the CLS infection and increased the yield up to 0.54t/ha. Improved ICM system is vital to reduce loss, improve soil condition, and enhance yield and income.\n",
      "The application of magnetic technology to agricultural productions is considered new breakthroughs to the enhancement of food production. However, studies about its application on the hydroponic system of production on high valued crops are limited. Hence, the present study assessed the effect of magnetically-treated water on the growth and yield parameters of lettuce in hydroponic system. Magnetic device with different number of permanent magnets was used to magnetize irrigation water in the hydroponic system. Uniform and healthy seedlings are transplanted and arranged completely randomized design. Magnetically treated water enhanced the growth and yield parameters of lettuce such as weekly height, leaf area, fresh weight, and root length. The height, leaf area, fresh weight, and root length increased up to 44.30%, 199.93%, 50.72%, and 37.00%, respectively vs. the control. Results revealed that magnetic treatment for water in hydroponic system has potentials to increase the growth of lettuce and consequently its yield.\n",
      "Rainforestation (RF) is a reforestation strategy designed to address the problem of dwindling Philippine forest landscapes by planting native trees to unproductive and idle lands. It was introduced in the early 1990â€™s to ensure that forests only have species that are endemic in the country. Using the method of hermeneutic phenomenology, this paper concludes that the Philippine indigenous tree species have enhanced the viability of Rainforestation as a major conservation strategy in the Philippines as compared to the exotic trees used by the government in the 1970s and 1980s and therefore, is very significant in promoting biodiversity and sustainable development.\n",
      "This paper primarily compares the spiritual well-being of students in a Catholic university classified according to their self-ascribed identity as creative and orthodox Catholics. With the use of a survey questionnaire, the demographic and academic profile and church involvement of students were first established and subsequently associated with their self-ascribed Catholic identity using Chi-square test. Meanwhile, the spiritual wellbeing of students was measured using the standardized 20-item Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS) test developed by Paloutzian and Ellison (1982). The t-test and one-way Analysis of Variance were employed to differentiate the spiritual well-being scores of students grouped according to their demographic and academic profile and church involvement. This paper shows that the orthodox Catholics significantly scored higher in spiritual well-being than the creative Catholics. Thus, teaching the meanings of Catholic beliefs and practices should be enriched with practical relevance so students would consider them not merely as part of Catholic rituals.\n",

Using Hermeneutic phenomenology the study interviewed ten informants and data gathered were analyzed using NVivo, a qualitative data analysis software. Findings revealed four themes: a) My mission, my passion; b) My Challenge, my victory; c) Caring beyond boundaries and d) My life, my salvation. The study concluded that the caring self of the care providers consist of three dimensions of caring: confident care, strategic care and enduring care. This became the basis in the development of a theory that states that the caring self is the foundation of all the caring experiences that enables one to become an effective care provider, otherwise known as the care agent.\n",
      "Stress has been identified as the antecedent for undesirable outcomes, such as depression and self-harm but there still lack of awareness on extent of its impact on academics most notably in a developing country like the Philippines. Thus, a multicenter and interdisciplinary study was employed on 501 students from six state universities in the Philippines. A questionnaire structured to assess the perception of the students as to the severity of identified stressors) as well as the prevalence of the coping mechanisms they adopt to overcome stress was used. The results indicated that academic stressors proved to be the main contributory factor to levels of distress among undergraduates. Educators and decision-makers should tailor regular student evaluations and programs that ensure the impediment of the sources of stress and other measures for further prevention.\n",
      "In the Philippines, the installation of solar panels on the rooftops of residential and commercial buildings has increased in popularity. Even if the country has high solar insolation, energy conversion is still inefficient since the solar panel arrays are not always facing in perpendicular to the sun. Technologies related to increasing the solar panel efficiency such as solar trackers are usually complex and expensive. This problem is addressed by designing a low cost dual axis solar tracker with the integration of specular reflector system. The dual axis tracker system can move the panel and the reflector assembly in a precise and controlled manner to ensure maximum output. This was achieved by using a LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) compass assembly, gear system, and stepper motor mechanism. To measure the solar panel output, a voltage sensing circuit was incorporated instead of using the existing optical and time-based techniques. The system performance was tested in both the controlled and the actual environments. Experimental data have shown that when the panel is perpendicular to the light source, the system yields maximum energy. The need for a tracking and planar reflector system is notably important when the light source moves away from the normal because this results to a significant drop of the panelâ€™s average efficiency. The addition of the tracker alone had greater enhancement effect than with the specular reflector only. The tracker boosts the efficiency by 69.55% while the specular reflector boosts it by only 15.12%. Combining the tracker and the specular reflector yields the best result with a 92.33% boost on the average efficiency.\n",

      "Language as a major contestation site for power can manifest linguistic behavior between sexes to negotiate their power.Â  Framed within the poststructuralist framework, this study explored a female radio hostâ€™s discursive strategies to negotiate power in the context of Philippine media.Â  Dominant discourse strategies identified include topic control, utterance length, minimal response, and overlapping.Â  Topic control was utilized to dominate the flow of discourse while utterance length was used to minimize turns thereby allowing the female host to establish dominance during the live conversations. Although considered a weak discourse strategy, minimal responses were used not solely for the purpose of solidarity but to introduce the female radio show hostâ€™s ideas.Â  Overlapping was another strategy identified to control and negotiate power.Â  On an interesting note, prosodic elements were found to be likewise used to negotiate power.Â  The study sheds light on previously claimed weak discourse strategies identified with women.Â  Weak language in this study as well as discourse strategies associated with men has been found to be used by women as means to an endâ€”asÂ  a strategy to negotiate positions of dominance within power relations involving the opposite sex.\n",

      "A moral life is indispensable to every human person. In the present day society where morality may vary from one understanding to another, there is a risk that its conception may be misconstrued by certain individuals. It is important in order for man to have a better understanding of what a moral life should be. A person who possesses a significant understanding of a moral theory like the Socratic ethics will have an underlying ethical foundation essential in facing situations that threaten his moral standards and beliefs. It is a fact that culture may play a role in the consideration of morality for a particular society, but this paper will focus on the individual personâ€™s concept of morality as taught by Socrates. Ethical Intellectualism is a standard of morality that may be imbibed and applied by the human person. It is an ancient method that can still hold true until today.

      "This descriptive-correlational study assesses the level of quality of Catholic education of five Recollect schools in Negros Island as assessed by school personnel and what they had done according to the framework of the Philippine Catholic School Standards (PCSS). Also, it determines whether a significant relationship exists between the demographic profile of the school personnel and their quality assessment in order to test the hypothesis that variation in their age, length of service, school origin and designation influence their respective assessments. Using the PCSS Survey Questionnaire, the data were analyzed using mean, Spearman rho, and chi-square. The findings reveal that the level of quality of Catholic education in Recollect schools exceeds the benchmark. Significant inverse relationship was found between between age and length of service of school personnel and their Catholic education quality assessment. However, no significant relationship was found between school of origin and designation and their quality assessment.\n",
      "Generally, the status of health and safety in the construction sector is reported to be declining. Consequently, this indicates the necessity of developing an awareness and a comprehensive knowledge among the role of various stakeholders in their contribution to construction health and safety improvement. As part of the construction industry stakeholders, the role of localities is one of the factors to consider in the formation of construction health and safety knowledge and practice. Despite the plethora of construction health and safety studies found in the literature, there have been very few studies that have considered the association between localities and their association with construction health and safety practices. In this paper, a Chi-square test of independence is used to investigate whether a disparity between localities and their safety practices exists. Moreover, this study contributes to existing literature in such a way that it is the first to consider the relationship between intra-locality and health and safety practices in the context of the construction industry. Furthermore, this study will be valuable for construction stakeholders in the formulation of a more unified and standardized health and safety practices and regulations.\n",
      "In the Philippines, farming communities produce copra using traditional open sun drying method that could be severely affected by heavy rainfall, temperature change, and intermittent sunshine, which could cause high microbial infection to the product. On the other hand, kiln drying may avoid these circumstances. However, smoke deposits in the finished product still cause farmers to have low-quality grade copra. Keeping this in view, an indirect heat copra dryer with phase changer (IHCDPC) was designed, fabricated, and evaluated in the hopes of providing farmers an alternative approach in drying copra, which may yield to producing a high-quality grade product. The developed IHCDPC was able to reduce the moisture content in fresh coconut meat from 57.4% w.b. to about 7.2% w.b. for a drying time of twenty-five hours. The IHCDPC was found out to have a thermal efficiency of 30.87%. The copra produced were graded as 84% MGC1, 13% MGC2, and 3% MGC3.\n",
      "The study aims to assess the extent of social media usage in talent acquisition in IT/BPM companies in Cebu and evaluate the insights of the applicants on the practice of using social media in character assessment for hiring decision. The quantitative method was employed to obtain data from two groups of respondents which constitute thirty hiring managers and ninety-six applicants. The study found that while hiring managers moderately practice social media background check to obtain additional information about the applicant, they seldom used it in hiring decisions because of the lack of formal or informal policy allowing or restricting the use of social media for that purpose. It is also found that there is a significant difference in perception between hiring managers and prospective applicants on usergenerated content on candidate social media profile.\n",
      "Cinnamomum cebuense (Kosterm.) is widely known as stomachache remedy, but adverse reaction to varying amount of herbal extract has also been reported, thus, requiring toxicity-profiling studies. Here, the toxicity of C. cebuense leaf extract (CCLE) was evaluated using brine shrimp lethality assay (BSLA) and anthelminthic assay under a complete randomized design with equal replications. Results in BSLA revealed an LC50 value of 7.05 Î¼g/ml (pâ‰¤0.05) which is considerably medium-toxic based on standard toxicity criterion. Influence on earthworm activity showed significant difference (pâ‰¤0.01) among the different concentrations of the extract (100 mg/ml, 75 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, and 25 mg/ml) following a concentration-dependent response trend. Results suggest strong toxicity against earthworms at 75â€“100 mg/ml while having a moderate to weak toxicity at 25â€“50mg/ml. Both assays were able to elucidate toxicity of CCLE which may be due to the presence of cinnamaldehyde, the main phytochemical found in cinnamon leaves. CCLE is toxic at elevated dosages and thus warrants parallel studies using higher-vertebrate models.\n",
      "Depressive symptomatology is among the major psychological problems experienced by adolescents. Sex differences in the occurrence of depressive symptoms have likewise been extensively reported in literature. However, a great majority of related research have primarily been carried out in the Western context. Hence, we conducted a study to identify the prevalence of depressive symptoms among Malaysian adolescents, and to determine its relationship with certain risk factors as well as the potential moderating role of sex. The sample comprised 964 adolescents from 20 secondary schools across Malaysia. Using logistic regression, results demonstrated that stressful life events and maternal verbal aggression significantly predicted symptoms of depression. In the moderation tests, sex significantly interacted with stressful life events and parental verbal aggression in predicting depressive symptoms. Hence, there is evidence to suggest that the depressogenic impact of stressful life events and parental verbal aggression on depressive symptomatology differs between male and female adolescents.\n",
      "There are two seemingly conflicting hypotheses on the status and impact of the Davao Filipino language. On one hand, Rubrico is optimistic that it could be a model variety of a more democratic and inclusive Filipino language that should be open to contributions and alterations from the other Philippine languages. On the other hand, Dolalas is giving a warning that the continued hegemony of the Tagalog/Filipino language on the Cebuano language will eventually destroy the latter. When conceptualized using the communication accommodation theory of Giles, the seemingly conflicting hypotheses would actually fit into a single construct that lines up the Cebuano language, the process of divergence, the Davao Filipino language, the process of convergence, and the Tagalog/Filipino language. Using the same communication accommodation theory, this paper assessed the validities of the two hypotheses, and attempted to formulate more acceptable hypotheses on the status and impact of the Davao Filipino language.\n",
      "Although past studies have validated the importance of active class participation in facilitating student learning, evaluating class participation remains a major issue. This study applies a token economy system to a Philippine university by awarding token currency to students who contributed meaningfully in class. After course completion, an online survey was administered to the 65 participating students, of which there were 26 completed responses. There was no evidence that the token economy increased student performance. However, survey results, coupled with student feedback, suggest that using a token economy is a viable alternative to traditional methods of evaluating student participation.\n",
      "This study determines why Gross Regional Domestic Product per Capita (GRDP) differs across regions in the Philippines vis-Ã -vis population rate, tertiary graduate rate, and crime rate as factors. Using Minitab, it examines the secondary data sets based on every group from various regions of the country. Findings show that educated human capital converge more in highly developed areas where risks matter less and safety measures exist. This results to a concentrated high GRDP in some. It further reveals that index and non-index crime rate is not a hindrance for a person to move in the area with many opportunities as long as life is not at stake. There were more educated individuals in regions with lower GRDP; however, they practiced and worked in highly developed areas and where law is enforced, eyeing a better condition of life. By implication, it results to concentration of educated labor force in areas with better opportunities.\n",
      "The paper assesses the solid waste management awareness, attitude, and practices of the employees and students of a Catholic higher education institution in the Philippines. Using a descriptive research design, the data were collected using a self-administered survey questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The major findings of the study show that the respondents demonstrated a very high level of awareness and attitude and high extent of practice of solid waste management. A significant difference was found in the awareness, attitude, and practices of respondents when they were grouped according to status and religion. Also, the findings established the relationship between awareness and attitude on one hand andÂ Â  the extent of practice of solid waste management. Awareness, attitudes, and practices were significantly related to age and educational level, except for sex which showed no correlation with attitude and practices. Generally, this paper validates how knowledge influences attitude that subsequently determines behavior particularly in solid waste management as intervened by appropriate environmental education.\n",
      "In this paper, I delve on Nietzscheâ€™s concept of perspectivism and how it becomes relevant amid contemporary societyâ€™s openness to relative standpoints. The foremost era that reflects this description points to postmodernism as a politics of difference. Nietzscheâ€™s perspectivism is generally a critique of the conditions that absolutize truth. While this may seem a valiant opening for a welcoming era on an epistemological standpoint, it does not however do away with its own paradoxes. I contend whether this fits well with postmodernism and its ironic relationship to truth and asserts further that the conditions for Nietzscheâ€™s perspectivism can only achieve its future if it hermeneutically stands as political consensus. Later, I will present the features of this perspectivism as political consensus and how it can be viable in postmodernity.\n",

Using two-sample and paired T-tests, results show that students under the experimental group, which applied the Feynman Technique, showed higher posttest scores and learning gains than those in the control group. Hence, this study proves that the Feynman Technique can be an effective tool to improve K-12 studentsâ€™ learning, especially now given the new learning delivery modalities.\n",
      "Green Chemistry (GC) integration in environmental education has improved understanding of managing pollutants and their impacts. However, the extent of integration in the science curriculum is not widely known in the Philippines. In this convergent mixed-method design, the researchers determined the SHS Chemistry teachersâ€™ (n=30) knowledge, perceptions, GC integration in Chemistry topics, and challenges in teaching Green Chemistry Education (GCE). Complementary quantitative and qualitative results showed valid and reliable findings, claiming that teachers have limited preconceived knowledge on GCE but perceived it as an essential part of the teaching-learning process. Awareness of chemical hazards and their impacts on the environment is often demonstrated but rarely elaborated during discussions in Chemistry classes. Problems encountered in teaching GCE were also identified. A moderate positive correlation between the teachersâ€™ knowledge and their GC perception was observed. However, no significant relationship was found when the teachersâ€™ knowledge and perception were correlated to GC integration.\n",
      "English proficiency has been a complex skill to develop in a face-to-face setting, especially in the remote learning modality. This descriptive-correlational study aims to determine the various macro and micro context factors in English language learning of secondary students (n=189) under modular distance learning. Factor analysis is utilized in extracting the following factor loadings for macro-context: a) lack of assistance from more knowledgeable others, b) unconducive-to-learning environment, c) cultural influence, d) poor feedback mechanism, e) insufficient resources, and f) low quality of the self-learning kit. Micro-context factors constitute the following: a) lack of exposure and practice, b) lack of perceived competence, c) lack of motivation and d) lack of interest. Students employed self-regulated strategies and managed to overcome these challenges through a) commitment to practice the skill, b) self-evaluation strategies, and c) social strategies. Studentsâ€™ context should be considered in the teaching and learning process.\n",
      "This paper highlights John Paul IIâ€™s (JPII) Philosophy of Labor and points out the need to have a Visayan philosophy of labor. Moreover, this proposes to view and analyze the Visayan philosophy of labor within the context of the Visayan notion of kahimtang. The researchers believe that the word kahimtang can be viewed as a combination of three words ka, himu and butang, in which himu connotes a concept of work. Furthermore, within the compatibilist minds of the Visayan, himu (labor) plays a significant role to redirect oneâ€™s kahimtang. Work (labor), for the Visayan, is an essential expression of freedom which has a similar expression to JPIIâ€™s Philosophy of Labor.\n",

      "The food safety compliance and challenges of microâ€“Food Business Operators (FBOs) that could impact COVID-19 are assessed in this study using the descriptive-comparative research design. The findings reveal that the sanitary conditions of utensils and equipment, the sanitary operations and facilities, the monitoring of time and temperatures, and the maintenance of the sanitary conditions in the facility need major improvement to increase food safety compliance and to contribute in mitigating the transmission of COVID-19. Minor improvements are needed in the handwashing facility, the implementation of the water potability program, Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures, personnel disease control, and hygienic practices. Moreover, the lack of technical knowledge and time to manage and continuously improve food safety system are the challenges experienced by the FBOs. These findings are instrumental to the improvement of the food safety practices, formulation of relevant policies, and conceptualization of research in mitigating COVID-19 relevant to food safety.\n",
      "The pandemic disrupts the functioning of most sectors and exposes the shortcomings and vulnerabilities among many. Literature search in leading databases reveals that though shocked by the crisis, many industries and organizations have reinvented themselves through various strategies to overcome the consequences of the pandemic. After a thorough analysis of individual articles, the authors found out that human resource management considers the disruptive changes in the working pattern, challenges, and opportunities ahead and makes appropriate changes to create an efficient workforce for the future with the help of technology that has become an inevitable companion in human resource management and not a panacea for uncertainties and crises ahead.\n",
      "This paper further investigates the cyclic group (Zp)* with respect to the primitive roots or generators g ∈ (Zp)*. The simulation algorithm that determines the generators and the number of generators, g of (Zp)* for a prime p is illustrated using Python programming. The probability of getting a generator g of (Zp)*, denoted by (Ø(Ø(p)))/(Ø(p)), is generated for prime p between 0 to 3000. The scatterplot is also shown that depicts the data points on the probability (Ø(Ø(p)))/(Ø(p)) of the group of units (Zp)* with respect to the order p - 1 of (Zp)* for prime p between 0 to 3000. The scatterplot results reveal that the probability of getting a generator of the group of units (Zp)* is fluctuating within the probability range of 0.20 to 0. 50, for prime p modulus from 3 to 3000. These findings suggest that the proportion of the number of generators of the group of units modulo a prime of order p - 1, though fluctuating, is bounded from 20% to 50% for prime p modulus from 3 to 3000.\n",
      "This paper provides an approximate analytic solution to the three species Lotka â€“ Volterra differential equations by symbolic regression. The approximate analytic solution through symbolic regression is made as close as desired to the actual analytic solution by using the Jacobian system. This is proposed as the equilibrium will be stabilized if and only if the real parts of each of the eigenvalues are negative. As a result, the symbolic regression approach is found to provide an approximation to the faster convergence that can be expected with a more refined Euler numerical approach.\n",
      "The implementation of the Republic Act No. 11203 mandates the development of a just and appropriate agricultural mechanization strategy. Thus, this study is conceptualized to calculate the rice machinery requirement and the mechanization level of La Union, Philippines. The utilization rate of existing machinery considers 100% and 70% in case the calculation is surplus. Furthermore, this aims to validate if there is no machinery requirement despite the 30% decrease in utilization rate. Hence, the results have revealed a need for 674 units of riding-type transplanters, 31 units of a rice combine harvester, 422 units of recirculating dryers, and 61 units of multi-pass rice mills. The rice mechanization level is moderately mechanized. However, only tillage operation is moderately mechanized; the transplanting, harvesting, drying and milling are low mechanised.

      "This paper deals with 1) angle trisection, 2) Bhaskaraâ€™s first proof, and 3) Pythagorean theorem. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, to show a new, direct method of trisecting the 900 angle using unmarked straight edge and compass; secondly, to show Bhaskaraâ€™s first proof of the Pythagorean theorem (c2 = a2 + b2) as embedded in this new, direct trisection of the 900 angle; lastly, to show the derivation of the Pythagorean theorem from this trisection of the 900 angle. This paper employs the direct dissection method. It concludes by presenting four points: a) the concept of trisectability as distinct from concept of constructability; b) the trisection of the 900 angle as really a new, different method; c) Bhaskaraâ€™s first proof of the Pythagorean theorem as truly embedded in this trisection of the 900 angle and; d) another way of deriving Pythagorean theorem from this trisection of the 900 angle.\n",
      "A novel computer vision application is developed to measure the deflection of two-dimensional (2D) reinforced concrete structural members. Eight beam samples, with dimensions of 160 mm x 150 mm x 1400 mm are loaded and simulated under a four-point loading test until failure using a reaction framework machine. A camera is fixed at the center front view of the concrete beams to capture the deflection of the samples while testing. In each test, a dial indicator is installed and the maximum deflection is manually recorded. Based on the results, the maximum deflection values recorded by the proposed application obtained an average error of 18.38 % when compared to the manual measured results. This indicates that computer vision-based application can provide a beam-wide scale deflection performance, compared to the traditional point-based deflection reading. This study paves a new possibility of aiding manual measurements of concrete beams and all other structural studies.\n",

      "This study is about the generated electricity from wastewater using carbon electrodes with the absence/presence of salt bridge through the biofilm anode of the microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology. The three wastewater samples used were from a pond, an abaca pulp mill, and rice fields. Results showed that one of the abaca pulp mill treatments, using carbon rod electrodes with salt bridge presence, reached the highest mean voltage and current to 578.7 mV and 0.2022 mV, respectively. The study revealed that the number of sensible power generation days, from start to end of experimentation, has a significant difference between treatments. Throughout the 20-day fermentation process, a total count of 8.94x105 colony forming units (CFU) per ml was found and purified from the biofilm anodes from pond wastewater. Likewise, 9.14x105 CFU per ml isolates from the abaca pulp mill, and 1.65x106 CFU per ml isolates from the rice field.\n",
      "Traffic flow mismanagement is a significant challenge in all countries especially in crowded cities. An alternative solution is to utilize smart technologies to predict traffic flow. In this study, frequency spectrum describing traffic sound characteristics is used as an indicator to predict the next five-minute vehicle density. Sound frequency and vehicle intensity are collected during a thirteen-hour data gathering. The collected sound intensity and frequency are then used to learn three machine-learning models - support vector machine, artificial neural network, and random forest and to predict vehicle intensity. It was found out that the performances of the three models based on root-mean-square-error values are 12.97, 16.01, and 10.67, respectively. These initial and satisfactory results pave a new way to predict traffic flow based on traffic sound characteristics which may serve as a better alternative to conventional features.\n",

      "The study aimed to develop a software application to capture tourist activity information, extract movement patterns from the dataset through sequential pattern mining (SPM), and visualize spatiotemporal movement. Tourist activity information was captured through crowdsourced trajectory movements by scanning unique QR (Quick Response) codes for each visited tourist spots. The AprioriAll algorithm was used to find frequent trajectory patterns on tourist visits. The resulting maximal k-sequences and their subsequences represent the recommended trip itinerary. The spatial and temporal movements were visualized through a flow map and a heat map, respectively. The directed edges in the flow map show the recommended sequence of tourist sites to visit. The heat map shows the density of tourist visits in different areas at time intervals. The application was validated with selected tour planning experts to verify functional suitability, usability, and acceptability. Experimental results show positive indicators that the application met the usersâ€™ expectations.\n",
      "COVID-19 has disrupted the education system globally, leading education institutions to migrate into remote learning. This study on online learning readiness and competence was conducted among management students on their perceptions on the importance of, and the confidence level of their online learning competence factors. Using the Student Readiness for Online Learning (SROL) instrument, the results show that the students consider Technical Competence as very important and that they are somewhat confident with their online learning competence. Both perceptions of the importance of the online competence factors and competency levels significantly correlate with the studentsâ€™ self-report of whether or not they have learned in the course. Among the eight online learning challenges, the students find the â€œlack of technical skills in using online learningâ€ as the least challenging. This study concludes with the recommendations that pedagogical and technological interventions be pursued to address the inadequacies in the online teaching-learning process.\n",
      "This study aims to determine the demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases that are highly susceptible to COVID-19 infection, with longer hospitalization and at higher risk of mortality and to provide insights that may be useful to assess the vaccination priority program and allocate hospital resources. Methods that were used include descriptive statistics, nonparametric analysis, and survival analysis. Results of the study reveal that women are more susceptible to infection while men are at risk of longer hospitalization and higher mortality. Significant risk factors to COVID-19 mortality are older age, male sex, difficulty breathing, and comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes. Patients with these combined symptoms should be considered for admission to the COVID-19 facility for proper management and care. Also, there is a significant delay in the testing and diagnosis of those who died, implying that timeliness in the testing and diagnosis of patients is crucial in patient survival.\n",
      "The present study describes the attempt to achieve the competencies of the Philippine K to 12 Science Program through thematic instruction. It seeks to address the challenges encountered by science teachers with the current curriculum design. The researchers used a thematic instructional model in giving classroom instruction. Two sets of pre-service teachers, taking part as facilitators and as observers, were purposely chosen in the study. The researchers used convergent mixed methods design in analysing the pre-service teachers' experience and observations in teaching through thematic instruction. Results revealed that the thematic instruction implemented in the study has the potential to address the challenges of the current K to 12 science curriculum in terms of design, lesson content, and implementation. Consequently, the results suggest that the thematic instruction design in the study can be used to help achieve the desired outcomes of the K to 12 Science Curriculum.\n",
      "In the Philippines, a mixture of public and private higher education institutions (HEIs) exists. Because of the government subsidy among the public HEIs, the major concern of the private sector is the â€œuneven playing fieldâ€. This study hopes to eliminate this unhealthy competition and market distortion in the educational landscape. This study utilizes the quantitative non-experimental retrospective explanatory design. Results show that regardless of the extent of state intervention, the market can be distorted. Hence, assigning specific programs to be offered based on the type of HEI is a good alternative. The programs to be fully subsidized and offered by the government are agriculture, sciences, engineering, manufacturing and construction, and humanities and arts (HA) while services, health and welfare, education and social sciences, business and law programs will be for private sector service providers. This stimulates healthy competition among the HEIs leading to a better\n",
      "Despite the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers continue to navigate the new normal in education which demonstrate their resilience. This descriptive correlational study determined the level of optimism, job stress, and emotional exhaustion of 150 teachers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and it analyzed the relationship among these three variables. The data were analyzed using weighted mean, standard deviation, and Pearson r. Results revealed resiliency among teachers amidst the pandemic with a high level of optimism and a relatively low COVID-19 induced job stress and emotional exhaustion level. This study has also shown that optimism is not correlated with job stress and emotional exhaustion, but it found out significant relationship between the last two variables. Generally, it can be concluded that teachers are highly optimistic amidst the pandemic. This paper also validates earlier claims that lower levels of job stress contribute to lower incidents of emotional exhaustion.\n",
      "Shifting to online distance learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic challenged educators' roles as instructional materials designers. This study aimed to examine the students' acceptance of the teacher-designed e-learning tool called Google Forms-based Lesson Playlist (GF-LP) in a home-based online distance learning environment. This quantitative research analyzed 570 responses from Grades 11 and 12 students at a private school in the Philippines using the partial least squares-structural equation modeling. Results showed that perceived self-efficacy and system quality strongly affect the users' perceived ease of use while perceived ease of use highly influenced the students' perceived usefulness of GF-LP. Facilitating conditions do not affect the users' attitudes towards using the e-learning tool, which confirmed the effective utilization of GF-LP in online distance learning. The relationships between the original constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) were also presented. This study recommends the use of GF-LP or its features for remote learning.\n",

      "Tambal Binisaya refers to the folk medicine used in Iligan City, Philippines. These medicines have been used for decades by mananambals or local folk healers and residents from low-income groups. However, because of modern treatments, the locals have started to move away from Tambal Binisaya. Because of this, many residents have become unfamiliar to Tambal Binisaya and the terms used in the trade. Thus, this ethnolinguistic study looked into the lexicon of Tambal Binisaya, specifically word formation processes involved in the names of these folk medicines. In doing so, the researcher employed interviews, observations and field notes in data gathering. Based on the results of the study, it was found that the morphological processes used are: affixation, enclitization, reduplication, metanalysis, compounding, blending, borrowing and coining. It is concluded that there indeed lies a rich trove of lexical items in Tambal Binisaya which should be given more societal and academic attention.\n",
      "Knowledge sharing in the academic setting can be conceptualized as a form of communication that has a potential for socio-cultural communication studies. This study argues that examining the discourse of James W. Carey on communication as culture, particularly his discussion on transmission and ritual views of communication, can deepen understanding of knowledge sharing among the research academics from a communication standpoint. Applying one of Herbert Blumerâ€™s assumptions on symbolic interactionism, this study further argues that the meaning of knowledge sharing as a form of communication among research academics could be found in the process by which the academics interact symbolically with others within and outside the academic community. The findings affirm through a phenomenological research design that knowledge sharing is communication. New perspectives in this communication phenomenon are examined through the ritual view of communication with interesting implications with the New Media Theory and with\n",

      "The marginal rate of returns (MRR) of higher education programs affect a countryâ€™s economy. It is in this light that the current study primarily intends to determine which higher education programs the state should fully subsidize and which programs the private education service providers should take charge of. The net effect of this identification is to rationalize the supply side of the economy. Quantitative non-experimental retrospective explanatory design and data mining techniques were used. Consequently, based on the programsâ€™ marginal rate of returns, indeed there are certain higher education services that bring about public good while some others do not. Agriculture, services, humanities and arts, sciences, health and welfare, engineering, manufacturing and construction, and education programs demonstrate greater public good while social sciences, business, and law generally promote greater private returns to the individuals rather than to the society.\n",

      "This study examined the religiosity and spiritual well-being of Catholic senior high school students of a rural Catholic school. Using the descriptive-comparative and correlational research design, data collection involved the survey questionnaires and hypotheses-testing used the Mann Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis, and Pearson r. In general, the students demonstrated a very high extent of religiosity, but they significantly differ when compared by grade level, church involvement, mass attendance, and Catholic identity. They had moderate spiritual well-being, but a significant difference was noted between males and females. Nevertheless, a significant relationship exists between religiosity and spiritual wellbeing, which suggests that the more the students observe Catholic teachings and practices, the more they mature in God's personal experience and achieve a sense of satisfaction and purpose in life. This study provides baseline data for developing the religious education curriculum and enhancing the campus ministry programs and activities of the said school.\n",
      "The adverse effect of depression, which is a significant health problem associated with loneliness and social isolation, leads to suicidal ideation, alcohol use, cardiovascular disease, and altered brain function. Administering them with appropriate and effective mental health outreach and treatment services can prevent and alleviate these effects.

      "Atang (food offering) is an indigenous ritual for the dead in the Northern Philippines. The atang ritual is thought to be a part of the cultural and religious contexts of the Ilocano people. This research argued that the Ilocanosâ€™ practice of atang ritual is compatible with the Catholic Doctrine on the Communion of Saints. This study utilized descriptive and contextual approaches in doing inculturation. It used the purposive sampling technique to Ilocano participants and discussed the development of doing a local theology of atang ritual in the faith of Ilocano Catholics. Results of the study revealed that the atang ritual has significant implications in the faith of the Ilocano Catholics in terms of the importance of remembering the dead as way to elaborate the doctrine of the communion of Saints. Thus, the concept of the communion of saints can be understood in the context of food offering for the dead.\n",
      "Research is a priority in higher education institutions. Considering that the development of research culture is highly influenced by the paradigm by which institutions operate on, this paper sought to identify the configuration of the research culture. The researcher conducted a narrative inquiry with key informants from seven reputable teacher education institutions in Region VII and coded the interview transcripts with the aid of NVIVO 11.3.2. Using Thematic Analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006), three overarching themes on the configuration of the research culture, with its corresponding attributes and characteristics, were identified. The results showed that the research culture consists of observable and measurable inputs and outputs that interact in internal and external dynamics that are developmental and systemic, leading to standardized and contextualized practices in a teacher education institution. Therefore, research culture is an investment, a process, and a norm as it is evidence-based, dynamic, and distinct to the academic institution.\n",

      "Fire incidence is a big problem for every local government unit in the Philippines. The two most detrimental effects of fire incidence are economic loss and loss of life. To mitigate these losses, proper planning and implementation of control measures must be done. An essential aspect of planning and control measures is prediction of possible fire incidences. This study is conducted to analyze the historical data to create a forecasting model for the fire incidence in Davao City. Results of the analyses show that fire incidence has no trend or seasonality, and occurrences of fire are neither consistently increasing nor decreasing over time. Furthermore, the absence of seasonality in the data indicate that surge of fire incidence may occur at any time of the year. Therefore, fire prevention activities should be done all year round and not just during fire prevention month.\n",

      "This study seeks to determine the effect of N fertilization method on ratoon lowland rice performance, to choose a fertilization method that provides high ratooned yield, and to assess its profitability adopting N fertilization method. The experiment lays out in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications and five N fertilization methods as treatments. Method of N application significantly affected the number of days to heading and maturity, plant height, leaf area index (LAI), number of productive tillers hill-1, panicle length and weight, number of filled and unfilled grains panicle-1. This method compensates cost of production of growing ratoon crop than those of the main crop. In fact, the highest profit (PhP25,564.80) was obtained in ratooned plants, which received 60 kg ha-1 N basal + 30 kg ha-1 N topdress application (T3) due to higher grain yield. Thereby, this is an appropriate option that provides high productivity and income for the ratoon growers.\n",
      "The outbreak of the COVID-19 has brought about tiring tasks and unending demands in the Philippine educational system. With the abrupt shift of the teaching-learning process, teachers are pressured and stressed, which leads them to be burned out. The descriptive correlational research design determines the direct and indirect effects of perceived control to burnout through teachersâ€™ personality traits of the 240 early childhood teachers. Data are analyzed using the Pearson r formula, Bivariate parametric correlation, and the Structural Equation Model (SEM). The study reveals that despite the challenges experienced in this time of pandemic, teachers have control over themselves and with the people around them. The teachersâ€™ level of control does not influence their burnout; instead, their burnout is dependent on their emotional stability. Thus, burnout is a personal choice which is triggered by oneâ€™s emotion. A person with high perceived control may still be burned out if he does not have control over his emotions.\n",
      "This qualitative research describes the experiences of Filipino graduate students as they continue with their schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic. Particular challenges faced are related to technology and internet access. As graduate work is expected to be about research tasks, subscribing to paid resources is seen as an issue. It is also crucial to recognize how the experience has caused stress for students. The experienced challenges are resolved by augmenting studentsâ€™ technological capacity, realigning personal values and perspectives, and resorting to free and open access journals to sustain research activities. The COVID-19 experience has taught graduate students the importance of technology, the significance of revisiting oneâ€™s values, and the reflection on their quest to finish their graduate studies. Lastly, assistance to graduate students can be done by proactively offering infrastructure assistance, socio-emotional support, and institutionalizing responsive and flexible communication mechanisms.\n",

       " 'text': 'St. John\\'s Gospel begins with a prologue, serving as an overture to the whole Gospel. This paper investigates the philosophical notions embedded in the first three lines of John 1:1. The inquiry focuses on whether or not the accepted meaning of this line as \"indicating timeless existence\" can be deduced from John 1:1 and whether or not John 1:1 also indicates the meaning of the \"principle of creation.\" This paper proceeds to make this inquiry in the following order: Introduction; The questions arising in John 1:1; Word as God is eternal, outside time; \"In the beginning\" as predicate; \"The Word was in the beginning\"; Timeless existence and the verb was; The Word as God is a principle of creation (which included the distinction between the concepts of anthropological intentionality and metaphysical intentionality); and Conclusion. This paper concludes by affirming the two questions on timeless existence and the principle of creation.',\n",

This paper investigates the philosophical notions embedded in the first three lines of John 1:1. The inquiry focuses on whether or not the accepted meaning of this line as \"indicating timeless existence\" can be deduced from John 1:1 and whether or not John 1:1 also indicates the meaning of the \"principle of creation.\" This paper proceeds to make this inquiry in the following order: Introduction; The questions arising in John 1:1; Word as God is eternal, outside time; \"In the beginning\" as predicate; \"The Word was in the beginning\"; Timeless existence and the verb was; The Word as God is a principle of creation (which included the distinction between the concepts of anthropological intentionality and metaphysical intentionality); and Conclusion. This paper concludes by affirming the two questions on timeless existence and the principle of creation.',\n",
