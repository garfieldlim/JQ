Information Technology

About this Course
Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT) and Master of Information Technology (MIT). The Master of Science in Information Technology Program offered at the University of San Jose – Recoletos introduces students the advanced theoretical and practical aspects of Information and communications technology. There is an in-depth approach to programming, a good balance in the development of competencies in both Open source based and proprietary technologies.

The MSIT program culminates with the completion of a Research and Development (RnD) Thesis Project. A Research and Development (RnD) Thesis Project, as operationally defined, is an undertaking that exhibits concepts and theories translated to Technology. A Thesis Project involves the analysis of an Information Technology case/problem and development of a solution/solutions to that problem. It should be innovative, or an improvement of an existing technology. With this RnD Thesis Project, the analysis and solution will prove that the student have mastered the knowledge and skills gained from the different subjects (Knowledge Areas) taken and the activities that they have performed throughout the masters degree program in Information Technology.

On the other hand, the MIT program, a CHED FDP (Faculty Development Program) culminates with the completion of a Software project. A software project covers the completion of software and a users manual which validates the students learning out of a combination of the different core and elective subject.
